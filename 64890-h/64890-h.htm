<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee,
author of the present essay on Translation, and of various
works on Universal and on Local History, was one of that
Edinburgh circle which was revolving when Sir Walter
Scott was a young probationer. Tytler was born at Edinburgh,
October 15, 1747, went to the High School there,
and after two years at Kensington, under Elphinston—Dr.
Johnson’s Elphinston—entered Edinburgh University
(where he afterwards became Professor of Universal
History). He seems to have been Elphinston’s favourite
pupil, and to have particularly gratified his master, “the
celebrated Dr. Jortin” too, by his Latin verse.</p>

<p>In 1770 he was called to the bar; in 1776 married a
wife; in 1790 was appointed Judge-Advocate of Scotland;
in 1792 became the master of Woodhouselee on the death
of his father. Ten years later he was raised to the bench
of the court of session, with his father’s title—Lord Woodhouselee.
But the law was only the professional background
to his other avocation—of literature. Like his
father, something of a personage at the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, it was before its members that he read the
papers which were afterwards cast into the present work.
In them we have all that is still valid of his very considerable
literary labours. Before it appeared, his effect on
his younger contemporaries in Edinburgh had already
been very marked—if we may judge by Lockhart. His
encouragement undoubtedly helped to speed Scott on his
way, especially into that German romantic region out of
which a new Gothic breath was breathed on the Scottish
thistle.</p>

<p>It was in 1790 that Tytler read in the Royal Society<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
his papers on Translation, and they were soon after
published, without his name. Hardly had the work seen
the light, than it led to a critical correspondence with
Dr. Campbell, then Principal of Marischal College,
Aberdeen. Dr. Campbell had at some time previous
to this published his Translations of the Gospels, to
which he had prefixed some observations upon the
principles of translation. When Tytler’s anonymous work
appeared he was led to express some suspicion that the
author might have borrowed from his Dissertation, without
acknowledging the obligation. Thereupon Tytler
instantly wrote to Dr. Campbell, acknowledging himself
to be the author, and assuring him that the coincidence,
such as it was, “was purely accidental, and that the name
of Dr. Campbell’s work had never reached him until his
own had been composed.... There seems to me no
wonder,” he continued, “that two persons, moderately
conversant in critical occupations, sitting down professedly
to investigate the principles of this art, should hit upon
the same principles, when in fact there are none other to
hit upon, and the truth of these is acknowledged at their
first enunciation. But in truth, the merit of this little
essay (if it has any) does not, in my opinion, lie in these
particulars. It lies in the establishment of those various
subordinate rules and precepts which apply to the nicer
parts and difficulties of the art of translation; in deducing
those rules and precepts which carry not their own
authority <i>in gremio</i>, from the general principles which
are of acknowledged truth, and in proving and illustrating
them by examples.”</p>

<p>Tytler has here put his finger on one of the critical
good services rendered by his book. But it has a further
value now, and one that he could not quite foresee it was
going to have. The essay is an admirably typical dissertation
on the classic art of poetic translation, and of literary
style, as the eighteenth century understood it; and even
where it accepts Pope’s Homer or Melmoth’s Cicero in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
way that is impossible to us now, the test that is applied,
and the difference between that test and our own, will
be found, if not convincing, extremely suggestive. In
fact, Tytler, while not a great critic, was a charming
dilettante, and a man of exceeding taste; and something
of that grace which he is said to have had personally
is to be found lingering in these pages. Reading them,
one learns as much by dissenting from some of his
judgments as by subscribing to others. Woodhouselee,
Lord Cockburn said, was not a Tusculum, but it was
a country-house with a fine tradition of culture, and its
quondam master was a delightful host, with whom it was
a memorable experience to spend an evening discussing
the <i>Don Quixote</i> of Motteux and of Smollett, or how to
capture the aroma of Virgil in an English medium, in
the era before the Scottish prose Homer had changed the
literary perspective north of the Tweed. It is sometimes
said that the real art of poetic translation is still to seek;
yet one of its most effective demonstrators was certainly
Alexander Fraser Tytler, who died in 1814.</p>

<p>The following is his list of works:</p>

<p>Piscatory Eclogues, with other Poetical Miscellanies of
Phinehas Fletcher, illustrated with notes, critical and explanatory,
1771; The Decisions of the Court of Sessions, from
its first Institution to the present Time, etc. (supplementary
volume to Lord Kames’s “Dictionary of Decisions”), 1778; Plan
and Outline of a Course of Lectures on Universal History,
Ancient and Modern (delivered at Edinburgh), 1782; Elements
of General History, Ancient and Modern (with table of
Chronology and a comparative view of Ancient and Modern
Geography), 2 vols., 1801. A third volume was added by
E. Nares, being a continuation to death of George III., 1822;
further editions continued to be issued with continuations, and
the work was finally brought down to the present time, and
edited by G. Bell, 1875; separate editions have appeared of the
ancient and modern parts, and an abridged edition in 1809 by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
T. D. Hincks. To Vols. I. and II. (1788, 1790) of the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Tytler contributed
History of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Life of Lord-President
Dundas, and An Account of some Extraordinary
Structures on the Tops of Hills in the Highlands, etc.; to

of his Sonnets (including the above pamphlet and the dissertation
mentioned above in Vol. V. of Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.), 1812;
Consideration of the Present Political State of India, etc., 1815,
1816. Tytler contributed to the “Mirror,” 1779-80, and to the

PRINCIPLES OF TRANSLATION</h1>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>There is perhaps no department of literature
which has been less the object of cultivation,
than the <i>Art of Translating</i>. Even among the
ancients, who seem to have had a very just idea
of its importance, and who have accordingly
ranked it among the most useful branches of
literary education, we meet with no attempt to
unfold the principles of this art, or to reduce it to
rules. In the works of Quinctilian, of Cicero,
and of the Younger Pliny, we find many passages
which prove that these authors had made translation
their peculiar study; and, conscious themselves
of its utility, they have strongly recommended
the practice of it, as essential towards
the formation both of a good writer and an
accomplished orator.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But it is much to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
regretted, that they who were so eminently well
qualified to furnish instruction in the art itself,
have contributed little more to its advancement
than by some general recommendations of its
importance. If indeed time had spared to us any
complete or finished specimens of translation
from the hand of those great masters, it had been
some compensation for the want of actual precepts,
to have been able to have deduced them
ourselves from those exquisite models. But of
ancient translations the fragments that remain
are so inconsiderable, and so much mutilated,
that we can scarcely derive from them any
advantage.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>To the moderns the art of translation is of
greater importance than it was to the ancients, in
the same proportion that the great mass of
ancient and of modern literature, accumulated up
to the present times, bears to the general stock
of learning in the most enlightened periods of
antiquity. But it is a singular consideration,
that under the daily experience of the advantages
of good translations, in opening to us all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
stores of ancient knowledge, and creating a free
intercourse of science and of literature between
all modern nations, there should have been so
little done towards the improvement of the art
itself, by investigating its laws, or unfolding its
principles. Unless a very short essay, published
by M. D’Alembert, in his <i>Mélanges de Litterature,
d’Histoire, &amp;c.</i> as introductory to his translations
of some pieces of Tacitus, and some remarks on
translation by the Abbé Batteux, in his <i>Principes
de la Litterature</i>, I have met with nothing that
has been written professedly upon the subject.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
The observations of M. D’Alembert, though
extremely judicious, are too general to be considered
as rules, or even principles of the art;
and the remarks of the Abbé Batteux are employed
chiefly on what may be termed the
Philosophy of Grammar, and seem to have for
their principal object the ascertainment of the
analogy that one language bears to another, or
the pointing out of those circumstances of construction
and arrangement in which languages
either agree with, or differ from each other.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>While such has been our ignorance of the
principles of this art, it is not at all wonderful,
that amidst the numberless translations which
every day appear, both of the works of the
ancients and moderns, there should be so few
that are possessed of real merit. The utility of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
translations is universally felt, and therefore
there is a continual demand for them. But this
very circumstance has thrown the practice of
translation into mean and mercenary hands. It
is a profession which, it is generally believed,
may be exercised with a very small portion of
genius or abilities.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> “It seems to me,” says
Dryden, “that the true reason why we have so
few versions that are tolerable, is, because there
are so few who have all the talents requisite for
translation, and that there is so little praise and
small encouragement for so considerable a part
of learning” (<i>Pref. to Ovid’s Epistles</i>).</p>

<p>It must be owned, at the same time, that there
<i>have been</i>, and that there <i>are</i> men of genius
among the moderns who have vindicated the
dignity of this art so ill-appreciated, and who
have furnished us with excellent translations,
both of the ancient classics, and of the productions
of foreign writers of our own and of
former ages. These works lay open a great field
of useful criticism; and from them it is certainly
possible to draw the principles of that art which
has never yet been methodised, and to establish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
its rules and precepts. Towards this purpose,
even the worst translations would have their
utility, as in such a critical exercise, it would be
equally necessary to illustrate defects as to
exemplify perfections.</p>

<p>An attempt of this kind forms the subject of
the following Essay, in which the Author solicits
indulgence, both for the imperfections of his
treatise, and perhaps for some errors of opinion.
His apology for the first, is, that he does not
pretend to exhaust the subject, or to treat it in
all its amplitude, but only to point out the
general principles of the art; and for the last,
that in matters where the ultimate appeal is to
Taste, it is almost impossible to be secure of the
solidity of our opinions, when the criterion of
their truth is so very uncertain.</p>

<p class="subhead">DESCRIPTION OF A GOOD TRANSLATION—GENERAL
RULES FLOWING FROM THAT
DESCRIPTION</p>

</div>

<p>If it were possible accurately to define, or,
perhaps more properly, to describe what is
meant by a <i>good Translation</i>, it is evident that
a considerable progress would be made towards
establishing the Rules of the <i>Art</i>; for these
Rules would flow naturally from that definition
or description. But there is no subject of
criticism where there has been so much difference
of opinion. If the genius and character of
all languages were the same, it would be an easy
task to translate from one into another; nor
would anything more be requisite on the part of
the translator, than fidelity and attention. But
as the genius and character of languages is
confessedly very different, it has hence become
a common opinion, that it is the duty of a
translator to attend only to the sense and spirit
of his original, to make himself perfectly master
of his author’s ideas, and to communicate them
in those expressions which he judges to be best
suited to convey them. It has, on the other
hand, been maintained, that, in order to constitute
a perfect translation, it is not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
requisite that the ideas and sentiments of the
original author should be conveyed, but likewise
his style and manner of writing, which, it is
supposed, cannot be done without a strict
attention to the arrangement of his sentences,
and even to their order and construction.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
According to the former idea of translation,
it is allowable to improve and to embellish;
according to the latter, it is necessary to preserve
even blemishes and defects; and to these must,
likewise be superadded the harshness that must
attend every copy in which the artist scrupulously
studies to imitate the minutest lines or traces of
his original.</p>

<p>As these two opinions form opposite extremes,
it is not improbable that the point of perfection
should be found between the two. I would
therefore describe a good translation to be, <i>That,
in which the merit of the original work is so
completely transfused into another language, as
to be as distinctly apprehended, and as strongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
felt, by a native of the country to which that
language belongs, as it is by those who speak the
language of the original work</i>.</p>

<p>Now, supposing this description to be a just
one, which I think it is, let us examine what are
the laws of translation which may be deduced
from it.</p>

<p>It will follow,</p>

<p>I. That the Translation should give a complete
transcript of the ideas of the original work.</p>

<p>II. That the style and manner of writing
should be of the same character with that of the
original.</p>

<p>III. That the Translation should have all the
ease of original composition.</p>

<p>Under each of these general laws of translation,
are comprehended a variety of subordinate
precepts, which I shall notice in their order, and
which, as well as the general laws, I shall
endeavour to prove, and to illustrate by
examples.</p>

<p class="subhead">FIRST GENERAL RULE—A TRANSLATION
SHOULD GIVE A COMPLETE TRANSCRIPT
OF THE IDEAS OF THE ORIGINAL WORK—KNOWLEDGE
OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE
ORIGINAL, AND ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE
SUBJECT—EXAMPLES OF IMPERFECT TRANSFUSION
OF THE SENSE OF THE ORIGINAL—WHAT
OUGHT TO BE THE CONDUCT OF
A TRANSLATOR WHERE THE SENSE IS
AMBIGUOUS</p>

</div>

<p>In order that a translator may be enabled to
give a complete transcript of the ideas of the
original work, it is indispensably necessary,
that he should have a perfect knowledge of the
language of the original, and a competent
acquaintance with the subject of which it treats.
If he is deficient in either of these requisites, he
can never be certain of thoroughly comprehending
the sense of his author. M. Folard is allowed
to have been a great master of the art of war.
He undertook to translate Polybius, and to
give a commentary illustrating the ancient
Tactic, and the practice of the Greeks and
Romans in the attack and defence of fortified
places. In this commentary, he endeavours to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
shew, from the words of his author, and of other
ancient writers, that the Greek and Roman
engineers knew and practised almost every
operation known to the moderns; and that, in
particular, the mode of approach by parallels
and trenches, was perfectly familiar to them,
and in continual use. Unfortunately M. Folard
had but a very slender knowledge of the Greek
language, and was obliged to study his author
through the medium of a translation, executed
by a Benedictine monk,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who was entirely
ignorant of the art of war. M. Guischardt, a
great military genius, and a thorough master of
the Greek language, has shewn, that the work
of Folard contains many capital misrepresentations
of the sense of his author, in his account of
the most important battles and sieges, and has
demonstrated, that the complicated system
formed by this writer of the ancient art of war,
has no support from any of the ancient authors
fairly interpreted.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The extreme difficulty of translating from the
works of the ancients, is most discernible to
those who are best acquainted with the ancient
languages. It is but a small part of the genius
and powers of a language which is to be learnt
from dictionaries and grammars. There are
innumerable niceties, not only of construction
and of idiom, but even in the signification of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
words, which are discovered only by much
reading, and critical attention.</p>

<p>A very learned author, and acute critic,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> has,
in treating “of the causes of the differences in
languages,” remarked, that a principal difficulty
in the art of translating arises from this circumstance,
“that there are certain words in every
language which but imperfectly correspond to
any of the words of other languages.” Of this
kind, he observes, are most of the terms relating
to morals, to the passions, to matters of sentiment,
or to the objects of the reflex and internal
senses. Thus the Greek words αρετη, σωφροσυνη,
ελεος, have not their sense precisely and perfectly
conveyed by the Latin words <i>virtus</i>, <i>temperantia</i>,
<i>misericordia</i>, and still less by the English words,
<i>virtue</i>, <i>temperance</i>, <i>mercy</i>. The Latin word <i>virtus</i>
is frequently synonymous to <i>valour</i>, a sense
which it never bears in English. <i>Temperantia</i>,
in Latin, implies moderation in every desire,
and is defined by Cicero, <i>Moderatio cupiditatum
rationi obediens</i>.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The English word <i>temperance</i>,
in its ordinary use, is limited to moderation in
eating and drinking.</p>

<p>The following passage is quoted by the
ingenious writer above mentioned, to shew, in
the strongest manner, the extreme difficulty of
apprehending the precise import of words of
this order in dead languages: “<i>Ægritudo est
opinio recens mali præsentis, in quo demitti contrahique
animo rectum esse videatur. Ægritudini
subjiciuntur angor, mœror, dolor, luctus, ærumna,
afflictatio: angor est ægritudo premens, mœror
ægritudo flebilis, ærumna ægritudo laboriosa,
dolor ægritudo crucians, afflictatio ægritudo cum
vexatione corporis, luctus ægritudo ex ejus qui
carus fuerat, interitu acerbo.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>—“Let any one,”
says D’Alembert, “examine this passage with
attention, and say honestly, whether, if he had
not known of it, he would have had any idea of
those nice shades of signification here marked,
and whether he would not have been much
embarrassed, had he been writing a dictionary,
to distinguish, with accuracy, the words <i>ægritudo</i>,
<i>mœror</i>, <i>dolor</i>, <i>angor</i>, <i>luctus</i>, <i>ærumna</i>, <i>afflictatio</i>.”</p>

<p>The fragments of Varro, <i>de Lingua Latina</i>, the
treatises of Festus and of Nonius, the <i>Origines</i>
of Isidorus Hispalensis, the work of Ausonius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Popma, <i>de Differentiis Verborum</i>, the <i>Synonymes</i>
of the Abbé Girard, and a short essay by Dr.
Hill<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> on “the utility of defining synonymous
terms,” will furnish numberless instances of those
very delicate shades of distinction in the signification
of words, which nothing but the most
intimate acquaintance with a language can teach;
but without the knowledge of which distinctions
in the original, and an equal power of discrimination
of the corresponding terms of his own
language, no translator can be said to possess
the primary requisites for the task he undertakes.</p>

<p>But a translator, thoroughly master of the
language, and competently acquainted with the
subject, may yet fail to give a complete transcript
of the ideas of his original author.</p>

<p>M. D’Alembert has favoured the public with
some admirable translations from Tacitus; and
it must be acknowledged, that he possessed every
qualification requisite for the task he undertook.
If, in the course of the following observations, I
may have occasion to criticise any part of his
writings, or those of other authors of equal
celebrity, I avail myself of the just sentiment of
M. Duclos, “On peut toujours relever les défauts
des grands hommes, et peut-être sont ils les seuls
qui en soient dignes, et dont la critique soit utile”
(Duclos, <i>Pref. de l’Hist. de Louis XI.</i>).</p>

<p>Tacitus, in describing the conduct of <i>Piso</i>
upon the death of Germanicus, says: <i>Pisonem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
interim apud Coum insulam nuncius adsequitur,
excessisse Germanicum</i> (Tacit. An. lib. 2, c. 75).
This passage is thus translated by M. D’Alembert,
“Pison apprend, dans l’isle de Cos, la mort
de Germanicus.” In translating this passage, it
is evident that M. D’Alembert has not given the
complete sense of the original. The sense of
Tacitus is, that Piso was overtaken on his voyage
homeward, at the Isle of Cos, by a messenger,
who informed him that Germanicus was dead.
According to the French translator, we understand
simply, that when Piso arrived at the Isle of
Cos, he was informed that Germanicus was dead.
We do not learn from this, that a messenger had
followed him on his voyage to bring him this
intelligence. The fact was, that Piso purposely
lingered on his voyage homeward, expecting this
very messenger who here overtook him. But,
by M. D’Alembert’s version it might be understood,
that Germanicus had died in the island of
Cos, and that Piso was informed of his death by
the islanders immediately on his arrival. The
passage is thus translated, with perfect precision,
by D’Ablancourt: “Cependant Pison apprend
la nouvelle de cette mort par un courier exprès,
qui l’atteignit en l’isle de Cos.”</p>

<p>After Piso had received intelligence of the
death of Germanicus, he deliberated whether to
proceed on his voyage to Rome, or to return
immediately to Syria, and there put himself at
the head of the legions. His son advised the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
former measure; but his friend Domitius Celer
argued warmly for his return to the province,
and urged, that all difficulties would give way to
him, if he had once the command of the army,
and had increased his force by new levies. <i>At
si teneat exercitum, augeat vires, multa quæ provideri
non possunt in melius casura</i> (An. l. 2, c.
77). This M. D’Alembert has translated, “Mais
que s’il savoit se rendre redoutable à la tête des
troupes, le hazard ameneroit des circonstances
heureuses et imprévues.” In the original passage,
Domitius advises Piso to adopt two distinct
measures; the first, to obtain the command of
the army, and the second, to increase his force by
new levies. These two distinct measures are
confounded together by the translator, nor is the
sense of either of them accurately given; for
from the expression, “se rendre redoutable à la
tête des troupes,” we may understand, that Piso
already had the command of the troops, and that
all that was requisite, was to render himself
formidable in that station, which he might do in
various other ways than by increasing the levies.</p>

<p>Tacitus, speaking of the means by which
Augustus obtained an absolute ascendency over
all ranks in the state, says, <i>Cùm cæteri nobilium,
quanto quis servitio promptior, opibus et honoribus
extollerentur</i> (An. l. 1, c. 2). This D’Alembert
has translated, “Le reste des nobles trouvoit
dans les richesses et dans les honneurs la récompense
de l’esclavage.” Here the translator has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
but half expressed the meaning of his author,
which is, that “the rest of the nobility were
exalted to riches and honours, in proportion as
Augustus found in them an aptitude and disposition
to servitude:” or, as it is well translated
by Mr. Murphy, “The leading men were
raised to wealth and honours, in proportion
to the alacrity with which they courted the
yoke.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Cicero, in a letter to the Proconsul Philippus
says, <i>Quod si Romæ te vidissem, coramque gratias
egissem, quod tibi L. Egnatius familiarissimus
meus absens, L. Oppius præsens curæ fuisset</i>.
This passage is thus translated by Mr. Melmoth:
“If I were in Rome, I should have waited upon
you for this purpose in person, and in order likewise
to make my acknowledgements to you for
your favours to my friends Egnatius and Oppius.”
Here the sense is not completely rendered, as
there is an omission of the meaning of the words
<i>absens</i> and <i>præsens</i>.</p>

<p>Where the sense of an author is doubtful, and
where more than one meaning can be given to
the same passage or expression, (which, by the
way, is always a defect in composition), the
translator is called upon to exercise his judgement,
and to select that meaning which is most
consonant to the train of thought in the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
passage, or to the author’s usual mode of thinking,
and of expressing himself. To imitate the
obscurity or ambiguity of the original, is a fault;
and it is still a greater, to give more than one
meaning, as D’Alembert has done in the beginning
of the Preface of Tacitus. The original runs
thus: <i>Urbem Romam a principio Reges habuere.
Libertatem et consulatum L. Brutus instituit.
Dictaturæ ad tempus sumebantur: neque Decemviralis
potestas ultra biennium, neque Tribunorum
militum consulare jus diu valuit.</i> The ambiguous
sentence is, <i>Dictaturæ ad tempus sumebantur</i>;
which may signify either “Dictators were chosen
for a limited time,” or “Dictators were chosen
on particular occasions or emergencies.” D’Alembert
saw this ambiguity; but how did he
remove the difficulty? Not by exercising his
judgement in determining between the two
different meanings, but by giving them both in
his translation. “On créoit au besoin des dictateurs
passagers.” Now, this double sense it was
impossible that Tacitus should ever have intended
to convey by the words <i>ad tempus</i>: and
between the two meanings of which the words
are susceptible, a very little critical judgement
was requisite to decide. I know not that <i>ad
tempus</i> is ever used in the sense of “for the
occasion, or emergency.” If this had been the
author’s meaning, he would probably have used
either the words <i>ad occasionem</i>, or <i>pro re nata</i>.
But even allowing the phrase to be susceptible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of this meaning,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> it is not the meaning which
Tacitus chose to give it in this passage. That
the author meant that the Dictator was created
for a limited time, is, I think, evident from the sentence
immediately following, which is connected
by the copulative <i>neque</i> with the preceding:
<i>Dictaturæ ad tempus sumebantur: neque Decemviralis
potestas ultra biennium valuit</i>: “The
office of Dictator was instituted for a limited
time: nor did the power of the Decemvirs subsist
beyond two years.”</p>

<p>M. D’Alembert’s translation of the concluding
sentence of this chapter is censurable on the
same account. Tacitus says, <i>Sed veteris populi
Romani prospera vel adversa, claris scriptoribus
memorata sunt; temporibusque Augusti dicendis
non defuere decora ingenia, donec gliscente adulatione
deterrerentur. Tiberii, Caiique, et Claudii,
ac Neronis res, florentibus ipsis, ob metum falsæ:
postquam occiderant, recentibus odiis compositæ
sunt. Inde consilium mihi pauca de Augusto, et
extrema tradere: mox Tiberii principatum, et
cetera, sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul
habeo.</i> Thus translated by D’Alembert: “Des
auteurs illustres ont fait connoitre la gloire et les
malheurs de l’ancienne république; l’histoire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
même d’Auguste a été écrite par de grands génies,
jusqu’aux tems ou la necessité de flatter les condamna
au silence. La crainte ménagea tant
qu’ils vécurent, Tibere, Caius, Claude, et Néron;
des qu’ils ne furent plus, la haine toute récente
les déchira. J’écrirai donc en peu de mots la fin
du regne d’Auguste, puis celui de Tibere, et les
suivans; sans fiel et sans bassesse: mon caractere
m’en éloigne, et les tems m’en dispensent.” In
the last part of this passage, the translator has
given <i>two</i> different meanings to the same clause,
<i>sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo</i>, to
which the author certainly meant to annex only
one meaning; and that, as I think, a different
<i>one</i> from either of those expressed by the translator.
To be clearly understood, I must give my
own version of the whole passage. “The history
of the ancient republic of Rome, both in its
prosperous and in its adverse days, has been
recorded by eminent authors: Even the reign of
Augustus has been happily delineated, down to
those times when the prevailing spirit of adulation
put to silence every ingenuous writer. The
annals of Tiberius, of Caligula, of Claudius, and
of Nero, written while they were alive, were
falsified from terror; as were those histories
composed after their death, from hatred to their
recent memories. For this reason, I have resolved
to attempt a short delineation of the latter
part of the reign of Augustus; and afterwards
that of Tiberius, and of the succeeding princes;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
conscious of perfect impartiality, as, from the
remoteness of the events, I have no motive,
either of odium or adulation.” In the last clause
of this sentence, I believe I have given the true
version of <i>sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul
habeo</i>: But if this be the true meaning of the
author, M. D’Alembert has given two different
meanings to the same sentence, and neither of
them the true one: “sans fiel et sans bassesse:
mon caractere m’en éloigne, et les tems m’en
dispensent.” According to the French translator,
the historian pays a compliment first to his own
character, and secondly, to the character of the
times; both of which he makes the pledges of
his impartiality: but it is perfectly clear that
Tacitus neither meant the one compliment nor
the other; but intended simply to say, that the
remoteness of the events which he proposed to
record, precluded every motive either of unfavourable
prejudice or of adulation.</p>

<p class="subhead">WHETHER IT IS ALLOWABLE FOR A TRANSLATOR
TO ADD TO OR RETRENCH THE IDEAS
OF THE ORIGINAL.—EXAMPLES OF THE USE
AND ABUSE OF THIS LIBERTY</p>

</div>

<p>If it is necessary that a translator should give
a complete transcript of the ideas of the original
work, it becomes a question, whether it is allowable
in any case to add to the ideas of the
original what may appear to give greater force
or illustration; or to take from them what may
seem to weaken them from redundancy. To
give a general answer to this question, I would
say, that this liberty may be used, but with
the greatest caution. It must be further observed,
that the superadded idea shall have the
most necessary connection with the original
thought, and actually increase its force. And,
on the other hand, that whenever an idea is cut
off by the translator, it must be only such as is
an accessory, and not a principal in the clause
or sentence. It must likewise be confessedly
redundant, so that its retrenchment shall not
impair or weaken the original thought. Under
these limitations, a translator may exercise his
judgement, and assume to himself, in so far,
the character of an original writer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>It will be allowed, that in the following instance
the translator, the elegant Vincent Bourne,
has added a very beautiful idea, which, while it
has a most natural connection with the original
thought, greatly heightens its energy and tenderness.
The two following stanzas are a part
of the fine ballad of <i>Colin and Lucy</i>, by Tickell.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent2">I in my winding-sheet.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus translated by Bourne:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this translation, which is altogether excellent,
it is evident, that there is one most
beautiful idea superadded by Bourne, in the line
<i>Qua semel, oh!</i> &amp;c.; which wonderfully improves
upon the original thought. In the original, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
speaker, deeply impressed with the sense of her
wrongs, has no other idea than to overwhelm
her perjured lover with remorse at the moment
of his approaching nuptials. In the translation,
amidst this prevalent idea, the speaker all at
once gives way to an involuntary burst of tenderness
and affection, “Oh, let us meet once
more, and for the last time!” <i>Semel, oh! iterum
congrediamur, ait.</i>—It was only a man of exquisite
feeling, who was capable of thus improving
on so fine an original.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Achilles (in the first book of the <i>Iliad</i>), won
by the persuasion of Minerva, resolves, though
indignantly, to give up Briseis, and Patroclus is
commanded to deliver her to the heralds of
Agamemnon:</p>

<p class="noindent">The ideas contained in the three last lines are
not indeed expressed in the original, but they
are implied in the word αεκουσα; for she who
goes unwillingly, will <i>move slowly</i>, and <i>oft look

effect of the picture. It may be incidentally
remarked, that the pause in the third line, <i>Past
silent</i>, is admirably characteristic of the slow and
hesitating motion which it describes.</p>

<p>In the poetical version of the 137th Psalm, by
Arthur Johnston, a composition of classical
elegance, there are several examples of ideas
superadded by the translator, intimately connected
with the original thoughts, and greatly
heightening their energy and beauty.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>I pass over the superadded idea in the second
line, <i>lachrymæ fluminis instar erant</i>, because,
bordering on the hyperbole, it derogates, in some
degree, from the chaste simplicity of the original.
To the simple fact, “We hanged our harps on
the willows in the midst thereof,” which is most
poetically conveyed by <i>Desuetas saliceta lyras, et
muta ferebant nablia</i>, is superadded all the
force of sentiment in that beautiful expression,
which so strongly paints the mixed emotions of
a proud mind under the influence of poignant
grief, heightened by shame, <i>servili non temeranda
manu</i>. So likewise in the following stanza there
is the noblest improvement of the sense of the
original.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Imperat et lætos, mediis in fletibus, hymnos,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reflection on the melancholy silence that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
now reigned on that sacred hill, “once vocal
with their songs,” is an additional thought, the
force of which is better felt than it can be
conveyed by words.</p>

<p>An ordinary translator sinks under the energy
of his original: the man of genius frequently
rises above it. Horace, arraigning the abuse of
riches, makes the plain and honest Ofellus thus remonstrate
with a wealthy Epicure (<i>Sat.</i> 2, b. 2).</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Cur eget indignus quisquam te divite?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A question to the energy of which it was not
easy to add, but which has received the most
spirited improvement from Mr. Pope:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How <i>dar’st</i> thou let one worthy man be poor?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An improvement is sometimes very happily
made, by substituting figure and metaphor to
simple sentiment; as in the following example,
from Mr. Mason’s excellent translation of Du
Fresnoy’s <i>Art of Painting</i>. In the original,
the poet, treating of the merits of the antique
statues, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">queis posterior nil protulit ætas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Condignum, et non inferius longè, arte modoque.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is a simple fact, in the perusal of which
the reader is struck with nothing else but the
truth of the assertion. Mark how in the translation
the same truth is conveyed in one of the
finest figures of poetry:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Looks dazzled up, and, as their glories spread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hides in his mantle his diminish’d head.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the two following lines, Horace inculcates
a striking moral truth; but the figure in which
it is conveyed has nothing of dignity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pallida mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Regumque turres.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Malherbe has given to the same sentiment a
high portion of tenderness, and even sublimity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Le pauvre en sa cabane, où le chaume le couvre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Est sujet à ses loix;</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">N’en défend pas nos rois.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Cicero writes thus to Trebatius, Ep. ad fam.
lib. 7, ep. 17: <i>Tanquam enim syngrapham ad
Imperatorem, non epistolam attulisses, sic pecuniâ
ablatâ domum redire properabas: nec tibi in
mentem veniebat, eos ipsos qui cum syngraphis
venissent Alexandriam, nullum adhuc nummum
auferre potuisse</i>. The passage is thus translated
by Melmoth, b. 2, l. 12: “One would have
imagined indeed, you had carried a bill of
exchange upon Cæsar, instead of a letter of
recommendation: As you seemed to think you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
had nothing more to do, than to receive your
money, and to hasten home again. But money,
my friend, is not so easily acquired; and I
could name some of our acquaintance, who have
been obliged to travel as far as Alexandria in
pursuit of it, without having yet been able to
obtain even their just demands.” The expressions,
“<i>money, my friend, is not so easily
acquired</i>,” and “<i>I could name some of our
acquaintance</i>,” are not to be found in the
original; but they have an obvious connection
with the ideas of the original: they increase
their force, while, at the same time, they give
ease and spirit to the whole passage.</p>

<p>I question much if a licence so unbounded
as the following is justifiable, on the principle
of giving either ease or spirit to the original.</p>

<p>In Lucian’s Dialogue <i>Timon</i>, Gnathonides,
after being beaten by Timon, says to him,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Αει φιλοσκῴμμων συ γε· αλλα ποῦ το συμποσιον;
ὡς καινον τι σοι ασμα των νεοδιδακτων διθυραμβων ἥκω
κομιζων.</p>

</div>

<p>“You were always fond of a joke—but where
is the banquet? for I have brought you a new
dithyrambic song, which I have lately learned.”</p>

<p>In Dryden’s <i>Lucian</i>, “translated by several
eminent hands,” this passage is thus translated:
“Ah! Lord, Sir, I see you keep up your old
merry humour still; you love dearly to rally
and break a jest. Well, but have you got a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
noble supper for us, and plenty of delicious
inspiring claret? Hark ye, Timon, I’ve got a
virgin-song for ye, just new composed, and
smells of the gamut: ’Twill make your heart
dance within you, old boy. A very pretty she-player,
I vow to Gad, that I have an interest in,
taught it me this morning.”</p>

<p>There is both ease and spirit in this translation;
but the licence which the translator has
assumed, of superadding to the ideas of the
original, is beyond all bounds.</p>

<p>An equal degree of judgement is requisite
when the translator assumes the liberty of
retrenching the ideas of the original.</p>

<p>After the fatal horse had been admitted within
the walls of Troy, Virgil thus describes the
coming on of that night which was to witness
the destruction of the city:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Vertitur interea cœlum, et ruit oceano nox,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Involvens umbrâ magnâ terramque polumque,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Myrmidonumque dolos.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The principal effect attributed to the night
in this description, and certainly the most
interesting, is its concealment of the treachery
of the Greeks. Add to this, the beauty which
the picture acquires from this association of
natural with moral effects. How inexcusable
then must Mr. Dryden appear, who, in his
translation, has suppressed the <i>Myrmidonumque
dolos</i> altogether?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mean time the rapid heav’ns roll’d down the light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on the shaded ocean rush’d the night:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our men secure, &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ogilby, with less of the spirit of poetry, has
done more justice to the original:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile night rose from sea, whose spreading shade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hides heaven and earth, and plots the Grecians laid.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Pope, in his translation of the <i>Iliad</i>, has,
in the parting scene between Hector and Andromache
(vi. 466), omitted a particular respecting
the dress of the nurse, which he thought an
impropriety in the picture. Homer says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Αψ δ’ ὁ παϊς προς κολπον ἐϋζωνοιο τιθηνης</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Εκλινθη ἰαχων.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“The boy crying, threw himself back into the
arms of his nurse, whose waist was elegantly
girt.” Mr. Pope, who has suppressed the
epithet descriptive of the waist, has incurred on
that account the censure of Mr. Melmoth, who
says, “He has not touched the picture with that
delicacy of pencil which graces the original, as
he has entirely lost the beauty of one of the
figures.—Though the hero and his son were designed
to draw our principal attention, Homer
intended likewise that we should cast a glance
towards the nurse” (<i>Fitzosborne’s Letters</i>, l. 43).
If this was Homer’s intention, he has, in my
opinion, shewn less good taste in this instance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
than his translator, who has, I think with much
propriety, left out the compliment to the nurse’s
waist altogether. And this liberty of the translator
was perfectly allowable; for Homer’s
epithets are often nothing more than mere
expletives, or additional designations of his persons.
They are always, it is true, significant of
some principal attribute of the person; but they
are often applied by the poet in circumstances
where the mention of that attribute is quite
preposterous. It would shew very little judgement
in a translator, who should honour Patroclus
with the epithet of <i>godlike</i>, while he is
blowing the fire to roast an ox; or bestow on
Agamemnon the designation of <i>King of many
nations</i>, while he is helping Ajax to a large
piece of the chine.</p>

<p>It were to be wished that Mr. Melmoth, who
is certainly one of the best of the English
translators, had always been equally scrupulous
in retrenching the ideas of his author. Cicero
thus superscribes one of his letters: <i>M. T. C.
Terentiæ, et Pater suavissimæ filiæ Tulliolæ,
Cicero matri et sorori S. D.</i> (Ep. Fam. l. 14, ep.
18). And another in this manner: <i>Tullius
Terentiæ, et Pater Tulliolæ, duabus animis suis,
et Cicero Matri optimæ, suavissimæ sorori</i> (lib.
14, ep. 14). Why are these addresses entirely
sunk in the translation, and a naked title poorly
substituted for them, “To Terentia and Tullia,”
and “To the same”? The addresses to these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
letters give them their highest value, as they
mark the warmth of the author’s heart, and the
strength of his conjugal and paternal affections.</p>

<p>In one of Pliny’s Epistles, speaking of Regulus,
he says, <i>Ut ipse mihi dixerit quum consuleret,
quam citò sestertium sexcenties impleturus esset,
invenisse se exta duplicata, quibus portendi millies
et ducenties habiturum</i> (Plin. Ep. l. 2, ep. 20).
Thus translated by Melmoth, “That he once
told me, upon consulting the omens, to know
how soon he should be worth sixty millions of
sesterces, he found them so favourable to him
as to portend that he should possess double
that sum.” Here a material part of the original
idea is omitted; no less than that very circumstance
upon which the omen turned, viz.,
that the entrails of the victim were double.</p>

<p>Analogous to this liberty of adding to or
retrenching from the ideas of the original, is the
liberty which a translator may take of correcting
what appears to him a careless or inaccurate
expression of the original, where that inaccuracy
seems materially to affect the sense. Tacitus
says, when Tiberius was entreated to take upon
him the government of the empire, <i>Ille variè
disserebat, de magnitudine imperii, suâ modestiâ</i>
(An. l. 1, c. 11). Here the word <i>modestiâ</i> is
improperly applied. The author could not
mean to say, that Tiberius discoursed to the
people about his own modesty. He wished
that his discourse should seem to proceed from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
modesty; but he did not talk to them about his
modesty. D’Alembert saw this impropriety,
and he has therefore well translated the passage:
“Il répondit par des discours généraux sur son
peu de talent, et sur la grandeur de l’empire.”</p>

<p>A similar impropriety, not indeed affecting
the sense, but offending against the dignity of
the narrative, occurs in that passage where
Tacitus relates, that Augustus, in the decline
of life, after the death of Drusus, appointed his
son Germanicus to the command of eight legions
on the Rhine, <i>At, hercule, Germanicum Druso
ortum octo apud Rhenum legionibus imposuit</i>
(An. l. 1, c. 3). There was no occasion here for
the historian swearing; and though, to render
the passage with strict fidelity, an English
translator must have said, “Augustus, Egad,
gave Germanicus the son of Drusus the command
of eight legions on the Rhine,” we cannot
hesitate to say, that the simple fact is better
announced without such embellishment.</p>

</div>

<p>In the preceding chapter, in treating of the
liberty assumed by translators, of adding to, or
retrenching from the ideas of the original, several
examples have been given, where that liberty
has been assumed with propriety both in prose
composition and in poetry. In the latter, it is
more peculiarly allowable. “I conceive it,” says
Sir John Denham, “a vulgar error in translating
poets, to affect being <i>fidus interpres</i>. Let that
care be with them who deal in matters of fact or
matters of faith; but whosoever aims at it in
poetry, as he attempts what is not required, so
shall he never perform what he attempts; for it is
not his business alone to translate language into
language, but poesie into poesie; and poesie is of
so subtle a spirit, that in pouring out of one
language into another, it will all evaporate; and
if a new spirit is not added in the transfusion,
there will remain nothing but a <i>caput mortuum</i>”
(Denham’s <i>Preface to the second book of Virgil’s
Æneid</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>In poetical translation, the English writers of
the 16th, and the greatest part of the 17th
century, seem to have had no other care than
(in Denham’s phrase) to translate language into
language, and to have placed their whole merit
in presenting a literal and servile transcript of
their original.</p>

<p>Ben Jonson, in his translation of Horace’s
<i>Art of Poetry</i>, has paid no attention to the
judicious precept of the very poem he was
translating:</p>

<p>There were, however, even in that age, some
writers who manifested a better taste in poetical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
translation. May, in his translation of Lucan’s
<i>Pharsalia</i>, and Sandys, in his <i>Metamorphoses</i> of
Ovid, while they strictly adhered to the sense of
their authors, and generally rendered line for line,
have given to their versions both an ease of
expression and a harmony of numbers, which
approach them very near to original composition.
The reason is, they have disdained to confine
themselves to a literal interpretation, but have
everywhere adapted their expression to the
idiom of the language in which they wrote.</p>

<p>The following passage will give no unfavourable
idea of the style and manner of May. In
the ninth book of the <i>Pharsalia</i>, Cæsar, when in
Asia, is led from curiosity to visit the plain of
Troy:</p>

<p>Independently of the excellence of the above
translation, in completely conveying the sense,
the force, and spirit of the original, it possesses
one beauty which the more modern English
poets have entirely neglected, or rather purposely
banished from their versification in rhyme; I
mean the varied harmony of the measure, which
arises from changing the place of the pauses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
In the modern heroic rhyme, the pause is almost
invariably found at the end of a couplet. In the
older poetry, the sense is continued from one
couplet to another, and closes in various parts
of the line, according to the poet’s choice, and
the completion of his meaning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>A little gliding stream, which Xanthus was,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Unknown he past—and in the lofty grass</i></div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>The stone retain’d no sacred memory.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He must be greatly deficient in a musical ear,
who does not prefer the varied harmony of the
above lines to the uniform return of sound, and
chiming measure of the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Yet the <i>Pharsalia</i> by Rowe is, on the whole,
one of the best of the modern translations of the
classics. Though sometimes diffuse and paraphrastical,
it is in general faithful to the sense of
the original; the language is animated, the verse
correct and melodious; and when we consider
the extent of the work, it is not unjustly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>

greatest productions of English poetry.”</p>

<p>Of similar character to the versification of
May, though sometimes more harsh in its

<p>In the above example, the <i>solantia tollite
verba</i> is translated with peculiar felicity, “Silent
be all sounds of comfort;” as are these words,
<i>Nec quo prius ore nitebat</i>, “Which, oh! but ill
express’d his forme and beautie.” “No mortal
bands could force his stay,” has no strictly corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
sentiment in the original. It is a
happy amplification; which shews that Sandys
knew what freedom was allowed to a poetical
translator, and could avail himself of it.</p>

<p>From the time of Sandys, who published his
translation of the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid in
1626, there does not appear to have been much
improvement in the art of translating poetry till
the age of Dryden:<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> for though Sir John Denham
has thought proper to pay a high compliment
to Fanshaw on his translation of the
<i>Pastor Fido</i>, terming him the inventor of “a
new and nobler way”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of translation, we find
nothing in that performance which should intitle
it to more praise than the <i>Metamorphoses</i> by
Sandys, and the <i>Pharsalia</i> by May.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>But it was to Dryden that poetical translation
owed a complete emancipation from her fetters;
and exulting in her new liberty, the danger now
was, that she should run into the extreme of
licentiousness. The followers of Dryden saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
nothing so much to be emulated in his translations
as the ease of his poetry: Fidelity was but
a secondary object, and translation for a while
was considered as synonymous with paraphrase.
A judicious spirit of criticism was now wanting
to prescribe bounds to this increasing licence,
and to determine to what precise degree a
poetical translator might assume to himself the
character of an original writer. In that design,
Roscommon wrote his <i>Essay on Translated
Verse</i>; in which, in general, he has shewn
great critical judgement; but proceeding, as all
reformers, with rigour, he has, amidst many
excellent precepts on the subject, laid down one
rule, which every true poet (and such only
should attempt to translate a poet) must consider
as a very prejudicial restraint. After
judiciously recommending to the translator, first
to possess himself of the sense and meaning of
his author, and then to imitate his manner and
style, he thus prescribes a general rule,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Your author always will the best advise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fall when he falls, and when he rises, rise.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Far from adopting the former part of this
maxim, I conceive it to be the duty of a poetical
translator, never to suffer his original to fall.
He must maintain with him a perpetual contest
of genius; he must attend him in his highest
flights, and soar, if he can, beyond him: and
when he perceives, at any time, a diminution of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
his powers, when he sees a drooping wing, he
must raise him on his own pinions.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Homer
has been judged by the best critics to fall at
times beneath himself, and to offend, by introducing
low images and puerile allusions. Yet
how admirably is this defect veiled over, or
altogether removed, by his translator Pope. In
the beginning of the eighth book of the <i>Iliad</i>,
Jupiter is introduced in great majesty, calling a
council of the gods, and giving them a solemn
charge to observe a strict neutrality between the
Greeks and Trojans:</p>

summoned a council of the gods

Olympus; and while he thus harangued, all the

<p>“Hear me, all ye gods and goddesses, whilst I
declare to you the dictates of my inmost heart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Let neither male nor female of the gods attempt
to controvert what I shall say; but let all submissively
assent, that I may speedily accomplish
my undertakings: for whoever of you shall be
found withdrawing to give aid either to the
Trojans or Greeks, shall return to Olympus
marked with dishonourable wounds; or else I
will seize him and hurl him down to gloomy
Tartarus, where there is a deep dungeon under
the earth, with gates of iron, and a threshold
of brass, as far below hell, as the earth is below
the heavens. Then he will know how
much stronger I am than all the other gods.
But come now, and make trial, that ye may all
be convinced. Suspend a golden chain from
heaven, and hang all by one end of it, with your
whole weight, gods and goddesses together:
you will never pull down from the heaven to the
earth, Jupiter, the supreme counsellor, though
you should strain with your utmost force. But
when I chuse to pull, I will raise you all, with
the earth and sea together, and fastening the
chain to the top of Olympus, will keep you all
suspended at it. So much am I superior both
to gods and men.”</p>

<p>It must be owned, that this speech is far
beneath the dignity of the Thunderer; that
the braggart vaunting in the beginning of it
is nauseous; and that a mean and ludicrous
picture is presented, by the whole group of
gods and goddesses pulling at one end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
a chain, and Jupiter at the other. To veil
these defects in a translation was difficult;<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> but
to give any degree of dignity to this speech
required certainly most uncommon powers.
Yet I am much mistaken, if Mr. Pope has
not done so. I shall take the passage from
the beginning:</p>

<p>It would be endless to point out all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
instances in which Mr. Pope has improved
both upon the thought and expression of
his original. We find frequently in Homer,
amidst the most striking beauties, some circumstances
introduced which diminish the merit of
the thought or of the description. In such
instances, the good taste of the translator
invariably covers the defect of the original,
and often converts it into an additional beauty.
Thus, in the simile in the beginning of the
third book, there is one circumstance which
offends against good taste.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ευτ’ ορεος κορυφῆσι Νοτος κατεχευεν ὀμιχλην,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ποιμεσιν ουτὶ φιλην, κλεπτη δε τε νυκτος αμεινω,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Τὸσσον τις τ’ επιλευσσει, ὅσον τ’ επι λααν ἵησιν·</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ὡς ἂρα των ὓπο ποσσι κονισσαλος ωρνυτ’ αελλης</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“As when the south wind pours a thick
cloud upon the tops of the mountains, whose
shade is unpleasant to the shepherds, but
more commodious to the thief than the night
itself, and when the gloom is so intense,
that one cannot see farther than he can throw
a stone: So rose the dust under the feet of
the Greeks marching silently to battle.”</p>

<p>With what superior taste has the translator
heightened this simile, and exchanged the
offending circumstance for a beauty. The
fault is in the third line; τοσσον τις τ’ επιλευσσει,
&amp;c., which is a mean idea, compared with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
that which Mr. Pope has substituted in its
stead:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus from his shaggy wings when Eurus sheds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A night of vapours round the mountain-heads,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lost and confus’d amidst the thicken’d day:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So wrapt in gath’ring dust the Grecian train,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A moving cloud, swept on and hid the plain.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the ninth book of the <i>Iliad</i>, where Phœnix
reminds Achilles of the care he had taken of him
while an infant, one circumstance extremely mean,
and even disgusting, is found in the original.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">“When I placed you before my knees, I filled
you full with meat, and gave you wine, which
you often vomited upon my bosom, and stained
my clothes, in your troublesome infancy.” The
English reader certainly feels an obligation to
the translator for sinking altogether this nauseous
image, which, instead of heightening the picture,
greatly debases it:</p>

<p>But even the highest beauties of the original
receive additional lustre from this admirable
translator.</p>

<p>A striking example of this kind has been
remarked by Mr. Melmoth.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It is the translation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of that picture in the end of the eighth
book of the <i>Iliad</i>, which Eustathius esteemed the
finest night-piece that could be found in poetry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>“As when the resplendent moon appears in
the serene canopy of the heavens, surrounded
with beautiful stars, when every breath of air is
hush’d, when the high watch-towers, the hills,
and woods, are distinctly seen; when the sky
appears to open to the sight in all its boundless
extent; and when the shepherd’s heart is delighted
within him.” How nobly is this picture
raised and improved by Mr. Pope!</p>

<p>These passages from Pope’s <i>Homer</i> afford
examples of a translator’s improvement of his
original, by a happy amplification and embellishment
of his imagery, or by the judicious correction
of defects; but to fix the precise degree to
which this amplification, this embellishment, and
this liberty of correction, may extend, requires a
great exertion of judgement. It may be useful
to remark some instances of the want of this
judgement.</p>

<p>It is always a fault when the translator adds
to the sentiment of the original author, what
does not strictly accord with his characteristic
mode of thinking, or expressing himself.</p>

<p>No author of real genius is more censurable

<p>Of these four lines, there are scarcely more
than four words which are warranted by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
original. “Some block the narrow streets.”
Even this is a faulty translation of <i>Obsidere alii
telis angusta viarum</i>; but it fails on the score of
mutilation, not redundancy. The rest of the
ideas which compose these four lines, are the
original property of the translator; and the
antithetical witticism in the concluding line, is
far beneath the chaste simplicity of Virgil.</p>

<p>The same author, Virgil, in describing a
pestilential disorder among the cattle, gives
the following beautiful picture, which, as

<p>“I would appeal to the reader,” says Dr. Beattie,
“whether, by debasing the charming simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
of <i>It tristis arator</i> with his blasphemous paraphrase,
Dryden has not destroyed the beauty of
the passage.” He has undoubtedly, even although
the translation had been otherwise faultless. But
it is very far from being so. <i>Duro fumans sub
vomere</i>, is not translated at all, and another idea
is put in its place. <i>Extremosque ciet gemitus</i>, a
most striking part of the description, is likewise
entirely omitted. “Spews a flood” is vulgar and
nauseous; and “a flood of foamy madness” is
nonsense. In short, the whole passage in the
translation is a mass of error and impropriety.</p>

<p>The simple expression, <i>Jam Procyon furit</i>, in
Horace, 3, 29, is thus translated by the same
author:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This <i>barking</i> of a <i>star</i> is a bad specimen of the
music of the spheres. Dryden, from the fervour
of his imagination, and the rapidity with which
he composed, is frequently guilty of similar
impropriety in his metaphorical language. Thus,
in his version of Du Fresnoy, <i>de Arte Graphica</i>,
he translates</p>

<p>“Neither would I extinguish the <i>fire</i> of a <i>vein</i>
which is lively and abundant.”</p>

<p>The following passage in the second <i>Georgic</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
as translated by Delille, is an example of vitious
taste.</p>

<p>The expression of the original is bold and
figurative, <i>lætus ad auras,—laxis per purum

offends the chastest taste. The concluding line

<p>Mr. Pope’s translation of the following passage
of the <i>Iliad</i>, is censurable on a similar account:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Λαοὶ μεν φθινυθουσι περι πτολιν, αιπυ τε τεῖχος,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Till heaps of dead alone defend the wall.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of this conceit, of dead men defending the
walls of Troy, Mr. Pope has the sole merit. The
original, with grave simplicity, declares, that the
people fell, fighting before the town, and around
the walls.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>In the translation of the two following lines
from Ovid’s <i>Epistle of Sappho to Phaon</i>, the
same author has added a witticism, which is less
reprehensible, because it accords with the usual
manner of the poet whom he translates: yet it
cannot be termed an improvement of the
original:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Scribimus, et lachrymis oculi rorantur abortis,</div>

  </div>

</div>

<p>But if authors, even of taste and genius, are
found at times to have made an injudicious use
of that liberty which is allowed in the translation
of poetry, we must expect to see it miserably
abused indeed, where those talents are evidently
wanting. The following specimen of a Latin
version of the <i>Paradise Lost</i> is an example of
everything that is vitious and offensive in
poetical translation.</p>

<p>The preceding observations, though they
principally regard the first general rule of translation,
viz. that which enjoins a complete transfusion
of the ideas and sentiments of the
original work, have likewise a near connection
with the second general rule, which I shall
now proceed to consider.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="subhead">SECOND GENERAL RULE: THE STYLE AND
MANNER OF WRITING IN A TRANSLATION
SHOULD BE OF THE SAME CHARACTER
WITH THAT OF THE ORIGINAL.—TRANSLATIONS
OF THE SCRIPTURES;—OF HOMER,
ETC.—A JUST TASTE REQUISITE FOR THE
DISCERNMENT OF THE CHARACTERS OF
STYLE AND MANNER.—EXAMPLES OF
FAILURE IN THIS PARTICULAR;—THE
GRAVE EXCHANGED FOR THE FORMAL;—THE
ELEVATED FOR THE BOMBAST;—THE
LIVELY FOR THE PETULANT;—THE
SIMPLE FOR THE CHILDISH.—HOBBES,
L’ESTRANGE, ECHARD, ETC.</p>

</div>

<p>Next in importance to a faithful transfusion
of the sense and meaning of an author, is an
assimilation of the style and manner of writing
in the translation to that of the original. This
requisite of a good translation, though but
secondary in importance, is more difficult to
be attained than the former; for the qualities
requisite for justly discerning and happily
imitating the various characters of style and
manner, are much more rare than the ability
of simply understanding an author’s sense. A
good translator must be able to discover at
once the true character of his author’s style.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
He must ascertain with precision to what class
it belongs; whether to that of the grave, the
elevated, the easy, the lively, the florid and
ornamented, or the simple and unaffected; and
these characteristic qualities he must have the
capacity of rendering equally conspicuous in
the translation as in the original. If a translator
fails in this discernment, and wants this
capacity, let him be ever so thoroughly master
of the sense of his author, he will present him
through a distorting medium, or exhibit him
often in a garb that is unsuitable to his character.</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of the historical style
of the sacred scriptures, is its simplicity. This
character belongs indeed to the language itself.
Dr. Campbell has justly remarked, that the
Hebrew is a simple tongue: “That their verbs
have not, like the Greek and Latin, a variety
of moods and tenses, nor do they, like the
modern languages, abound in auxiliaries and
conjunctions. The consequence is, that in narrative,
they express by several simple sentences,
much in the way of the relations used in conversation,
what in most other languages would
be comprehended in one complex sentence of
three or four members.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The same author
gives, as an example of this simplicity, the beginning
of the first chapter of Genesis, where
the account of the operations of the Creator on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
the first day is contained in eleven separate
sentences. “1. In the beginning God created the
Heaven and the Earth. 2. And the earth was
without form, and void. 3. And darkness was
upon the face of the deep. 4. And the Spirit
of God moved upon the face of the waters.
5. And God said, let there be light. 6. And
there was light. 7. And God saw the light,
that it was good. 8. And God divided the
light from the darkness. 9. And God called
the light day. 10. And the darkness he called
night. 11. And the evening and the morning
were the first day.” “This,” says Dr. Campbell,
“is a just representation of the style of the
original. A more perfect example of simplicity
of structure, we can nowhere find. The sentences
are simple, the substantives are not attended
by adjectives, nor the verbs by adverbs; no
synonymas, no superlatives, no effort at expressing
things in a bold, emphatical, or
uncommon manner.”</p>

<p>Castalio’s version of the Scriptures is intitled
to the praise of elegant Latinity, and he is in
general faithful to the sense of his original;
but he has totally departed from its style and
manner, by substituting the complex and florid
composition to the simple and unadorned. His
sentences are formed in long and intricate
periods, in which many separate members are
artfully combined; and we observe a constant
endeavour at a classical phraseology and ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
diction.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In Castalio’s version of the
foregoing passage of Genesis, nine sentences of
the original are thrown into one period. 1.
<i>Principio creavit Deus cœlum et terram.</i> 2. <i>Quum
autem esset terra iners atque rudis, tenebrisque
effusum profundum, et divinus spiritus sese super
aquas libraret, jussit Deus ut existeret lux, et
extitit lux; quam quum videret Deus esse bonam,
lucem secrevit a tenebris, et lucem diem, et tenebras
noctem appellavit.</i> 3. <i>Ita extitit ex vespere et mane
dies primus.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Beattie, in his essay <i>On Laughter and
Ludicrous Composition</i>, has justly remarked,
that the translation of the Old Testament by
Castalio does great honour to that author’s
learning, but not to his taste. “The quaintness
of his Latin betrays a deplorable inattention
to the simple majesty of his original. In
the Song of Solomon, he has debased the
magnificence of the language and subject by
<i>diminutives</i>, which, though expressive of familiar
endearment, he should have known to be destitute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
of dignity, and therefore improper on
solemn occasions.” <i>Mea Columbula, ostende mihi
tuum vulticulum; fac ut audiam tuam voculam;
nam et voculam venustulam, et vulticulum habes
lepidulum.—Veni in meos hortulos, sororcula mea
sponsa.—Ego dormio, vigilante meo corculo</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The version of the Scriptures by Arias Montanus,
is in some respects a contrast to that of
Castalio. Arias, by adopting the literal mode of
translation, probably intended to give as faithful
a picture as he could, both of the sense and
manner of the original. Not considering the
different genius of the Hebrew, the Greek, and
the Latin, in the various meaning and import of
words of the same primary sense; the difference
of combination and construction, and the peculiarity
of idioms belonging to each tongue, he has
treated the three languages as if they corresponded
perfectly in all those particulars; and
the consequence is, he has produced a composition
which fails in every one requisite of a good
translation: it conveys neither the sense of the
original, nor its manner and style; and it abounds
in barbarisms, solecisms, and grammatical inaccuracy.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
In Latin, two negatives make an affirmative;
but it is otherwise in Greek; they only
give force to the negation: χωρις εμου ου δυνασθε
ποιειν ουδεν, as translated by Arias, <i>sine me non
potestis facere nihil</i>, is therefore directly contrary
to the sense of the original: And surely that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
translator cannot be said either to do justice to
the manner and style of his author, or to write
with the ease of original composition, who, instead
of perspicuous thought, expressed in pure,
correct, and easy phraseology, gives us obscure
and unintelligible sentiments, conveyed in barbarous
terms and constructions, irreconcileable
to the rules of the language in which he uses
them. <i>Et nunc dixi vobis ante fieri, ut quum
factum fuerit credatis.—Ascendit autem et Joseph
a Galilæa in civitatem David, propter esse ipsum
ex domo et familia David, describi cum Maria desponsata
sibi uxore, existente prægnante. Factum
autem in esse eos ibi, impleti sunt dies parere ipsam.—Venerunt
ad portam, quæ spontanea aperta est
eis, et exeuntes processerunt vicum.—Nunquid
aquam prohibere potest quis ad non baptizare hos?—Spectat
descendens super se vas quoddam linteum,
quatuor initiis vinctum.—Aperiens autem Petrus
os, dixit: in veritate deprehendo quia non est
personarum acceptor Deus.</i><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>The characteristic of the language of Homer is
strength united with simplicity. He employs
frequent images, allusions, and similes; but he
very rarely uses metaphorical expression. The
use of this style, therefore, in a translation of
Homer, is an offence against the character of
the original. Mr. Pope, though not often, is
sometimes chargeable with this fault; as where
he terms the arrows of Apollo “the feather’d
fates,” <i>Iliad</i>, 1, 68, a quiver of arrows, “a store
of flying fates,” <i>Odyssey</i>, 22, 136: or instead of
saying, that the soil is fertile in corn, “in wavy
gold the summer vales are dress’d,” <i>Odyssey</i>, 19,
131; the soldier wept, “from his eyes pour’d
down the tender dew,” <i>Ibid.</i> 11, 486.</p>

<p>Virgil, in describing the shipwreck of the
Trojans, says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto</i>,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Which the Abbé des Fontaines thus translates:
“A peine un petit nombre de ceux qui montoient
le vaisseau purent se sauver à la nage.” Of this
translation Voltaire justly remarks, “C’est traduire
Virgile en style de gazette. Où est ce
vaste gouffre que peint le poête, <i>gurgite vasto</i>?
Où est l’<i>apparent rari nantes</i>? Ce n’est pas
ainsi qu’on doit traduire l’Eneide.” <i>Voltaire</i>,
<i>Quest. sur l’Encyclop. mot Amplification</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>If we are thus justly offended at hearing
Virgil speak in the style of the <i>Evening Post</i> or
the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>, what must we think of the
translator, who makes the solemn and sententious
Tacitus express himself in the low cant of
the streets, or in the dialect of the waiters of a
tavern?</p>

<p><i>Facile Asinium et Messalam inter Antonium
et Augustum bellorum præmiis refertos</i>: Thus
translated, in a version of Tacitus by Mr. Dryden
and several eminent hands: “Asinius and
Messala, who feathered their nests well in the
civil wars ’twixt Antony and Augustus.” <i>Vinolentiam
et libidines usurpans</i>: “Playing the
good-fellow.” <i>Frustra Arminium præscribi</i>:
“Trumping up Arminius’s title.” <i>Sed Agrippina
libertam æmulam, nurum ancillam, aliaque eundem
in modum muliebriter fremere</i>: “But
Agrippina could not bear that a freedwoman
should <i>nose</i> her.” And another translator says,
“But Agrippina could not bear that a freedwoman
should <i>beard</i> her.” Of a similar character
with this translation of Tacitus is a
translation of Suetonius by several gentlemen of
Oxford,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> which abounds with such elegancies as
the following: <i>Sestio Gallo, libidinoso et prodigo
seni</i>: “Sestius Gallus, a most notorious old Sir
Jolly.” <i>Jucundissimos et omnium horarum amicos</i>:
“His boon companions and sure cards.” <i>Nullam<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
unquam occasionem dedit</i>: “They never could
pick the least hole in his coat.”</p>

the Gods in council, is thus translated in a version
of Horace by “The Most Eminent Hands.”</p>

<p>The description of the majesty of Jupiter,

<p>In the translation of the <i>Georgics</i>, Mr. Dryden
has displayed great powers of poetry. But
Dryden had little relish for the pathetic, and no
comprehension of the natural language of the
heart. The beautiful simplicity of the following
passage has entirely escaped his observation, and
he has been utterly insensible to its tenderness:</p>

<p>Thus translated by De Lille:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Telle sur un rameau durant la nuit obscure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Philomele plaintive attendrit la nature,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Accuse en gémissant l’oiseleur inhumain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui, glissant dans son nid une furtive main,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ravit ces tendres fruits que l’amour fit eclorre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et qu’un leger duvet ne couvroit pas encore.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is evident, that there is a complete evaporation
of the beauties of the original in this
translation: and the reason is, that the French
poet has substituted sentiments for facts, and
refinement for the simple pathetic. The nightingale
of De Lille melts all nature with her
complaint; accuses with her sighs the inhuman
fowler, who glides his thievish hand into her nest,
and plunders the tender fruits that were hatched
by love! How different this sentimental foppery
from the chaste simplicity of Virgil!</p>

<p>The following beautiful passage in the sixth
book of the <i>Iliad</i> has not been happily translated
by Mr. Pope. It is in the parting interview
between Hector and Andromache.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Δακρυοεν γελασασα· ποσις δ’ ελεησε νοησας,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Restor’d the pleasing burden to her arms;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hush’d to repose, and with a smile survey’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The troubled pleasure soon chastis’d by fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She mingled with the smile a tender tear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The soften’d chief with kind compassion view’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dried the falling drops, and thus pursu’d.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This, it must be allowed, is good poetry; but
it wants the affecting simplicity of the original.
<i>Fondly gazing on her charms—pleasing burden—The
troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear</i>,
are injudicious embellishments. The beautiful
expression Δακρυοεν γελασασα is totally lost
by amplification; and the fine circumstance,
which so much heightens the tenderness of
the picture, Χειρι τε μιν κατερεξεν, is forgotten
altogether.</p>

<p>But a translator may discern the general
character of his author’s style, and yet fail remarkably
in the imitation of it. Unless he is
possessed of the most correct taste, he will be in
continual danger of presenting an exaggerated
picture or a caricatura of his original. The
distinction between good and bad writing is
often of so very slender a nature, and the
shadowing of difference so extremely delicate,
that a very nice perception alone can at all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
times define the limits. Thus, in the hands of
some translators, who have discernment to perceive
the general character of their author’s
style, but want this correctness of taste, the
grave style of the original becomes heavy and
formal in the translation; the elevated swells
into bombast, the lively froths up into the
petulant, and the simple and <i>naïf</i> degenerates
into the childish and insipid.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In the fourth Oration against Catiline, Cicero,
after drawing the most striking picture of the
miseries of his country, on the supposition that
success had crowned the designs of the conspirators,
closes the detail with this grave and
solemn application:</p>

<p><i>Quia mihi vehementer hæc videntur misera
atque miseranda, idcirca in eos qui ea perficere
voluerunt, me severum, vehementemque præbeo.
Etenim quæro, si quis paterfamilias, liberis suis
a servo interfectis, uxore occisa, incensa domo,
supplicium de servo quam acerbissimum sumserit;
utrum is clemens ac misericors, an inhumanissimus
et crudelissimus esse videatur? Mihi vero
importunus ac ferreus, qui non dolore ac cruciatu
nocentis, suum dolorem ac cruciatum lenierit.</i></p>

<p>How awkwardly is the dignified gravity of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
original imitated, in the following heavy, formal,
and insipid version.</p>

<p>“Now as to me these calamities appear extremely
shocking and deplorable: therefore I
am extremely keen and rigorous in punishing
those who endeavoured to bring them about.
For let me put the case, that a master of a
family had his children butchered, his wife
murdered, his house burnt down by a slave, yet
did not inflict the most rigorous of punishments
imaginable upon that slave: would such a
master appear merciful and compassionate, and
not rather a monster of cruelty and inhumanity?
To me that man would appear to be of a flinty
cruel nature, who should not endeavour to soothe
his own anguish and torment by the anguish and
torment of its guilty cause.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Echard, who saw no distinction between the
familiar and the vulgar, has translated this in
the true dialect of the streets:</p>

<p>“I think there never was such a long night
since the beginning of the world, except that
night I had the strappado, and rid the wooden
horse till morning; and, o’ my conscience, that
was twice as long.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> By the mackins, I believe
Phœbus has been playing the good-fellow, and
’s asleep too. I’ll be hang’d if he ben’t in
for’t, and has took a little too much o’ the
creature.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mer.</i> Say ye so, slave? What, treat Gods
like yourselves. By Jove, have at your doublet,
Rogue, for <i>scandalum magnatum</i>. Approach
then, you’ll ha’ but small joy here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“Mer. <i>Accedam, atque hanc appellabo atque
supparasitabo patri.</i>” Ibid. sc. 3.</p>

<p>“<i>Mer.</i> I’ll to her, and tickle her up as my
father has done.”</p>

<p>“Sosia. <i>Irritabis crabrones.</i>” Ibid. act 2, sc. 2.</p>

<p>“<i>Sosia.</i> You’d as good p—ss in a bee-hive.”</p>

<p>Seneca, though not a chaste writer, is remarkable
for a courtly dignity of expression, which,
though often united with ease, never descends to
the mean or vulgar. L’Estrange has presented
him through a medium of such coarseness, that
he is hardly to be known.</p>

<p><i>Probatos itaque semper lege, et siquando ad
alios divertere libuerit, ad priores redi.—Nihil
æque sanitatem impedit quam remediorum crebra
mutatio</i>, Ep. 2.—“Of authors be sure to make
choice of the best; and, as I said before, stick
close to them; and though you take up others
by the bye, reserve some select ones, however,
for your study and retreat. Nothing is more
hurtful, in the case of diseases and wounds, than
the frequent shifting of physic and plasters.”</p>

<p><i>Fuit qui diceret, Quid perdis operam? ille quem
quæris elatus, combustus est.</i> <i>De benef.</i>, lib. 7.
c. 21.—“Friend, says a fellow, you may hammer
your heart out, for the man you look for is
dead.”</p>

<p><i>Cum multa in crudelitatem Pisistrati conviva
ebrius dixisset.</i> <i>De ira</i>, lib. 3, c. 11. “Thrasippus,
in his drink, fell foul upon the cruelties of
Pisistratus.”</p>

<p>If any thing is faulty in this excellent translation,
it is the last stanza, which does not convey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the happy petulance, the <i>procacitas</i> of the original.
The reader may compare with this, the fine
translation of the same ode by Bishop Atterbury,
“Whilst I was fond, and you were kind,” which
is too well known to require insertion.</p>

<p>The fourth example is a translation by Dr.
Jortin of that beautiful fragment of Simonides,
preserved by Dionysius, in which Danae, exposed
with her child to the fury of the ocean, by
command of her inhuman father, is described
lamenting over her sleeping infant.</p>

<p>This admirable translation falls short of its
original only in a single particular, the measure
of the verse. One striking beauty of the original,
is the easy and loose structure of the verse,
which has little else to distinguish it from animated
discourse but the harmony of the syllables;
and hence it has more of natural impassioned
eloquence, than is conveyed by the regular
measure of the translation. That this characteristic
of the original should have been overlooked
by the ingenious translator, is the more remarkable,
that the poem is actually quoted by Dionysius,
as an apposite example of that species of
composition in which poetry approaches to the
freedom of prose; της εμμελους και εμμετρου συνθεσεως
της εχουσης πολλην ὁμοιοτητα προς την πεζην
λεξιν. Dr. Markham saw this excellence of the
original; and in that fine imitation of the verses
of Simonides, which an able critic<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> has pronounced
to be far superior to the original, has
given it its full effect. The passage alluded to
is an apostrophe of a mother to her sleeping
infant, a widowed mother, who has just left the
deathbed of her husband.</p>

<p>To these specimens of perfect translation, in
which not only the ideas of the original are
completely transfused, but the manner most
happily imitated, I add the following admirable
translations by Mr. Cumberland,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of two fragments
from the Greek dramatists Timocles and
Diphilus, which are preserved by Athenæus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>The first of these passages beautifully illustrates
the moral uses of the tragic drama:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, my good friend, but hear me! I confess</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Man is the child of sorrow, and this world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In which we breathe, hath cares enough to plague us;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But it hath means withal to soothe these cares:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he who meditates on others’ woes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall in that meditation lose his own:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call then the tragic poet to your aid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hear him, and take instruction from the stage:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let Telephus appear; behold a prince,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A spectacle of poverty and pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wretched in both.—And what if you are poor?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are you a demigod? Are you the son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Hercules? Begone! Complain no more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doth your mind struggle with distracting thoughts?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do your wits wander? Are you mad? Alas!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So was Alcmeon, whilst the world ador’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His father as their God. Your eyes are dim;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What then? The eyes of Œdipus were dark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Totally dark. You mourn a son; he’s dead;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn to the tale of Niobe for comfort,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And match your loss with hers. You’re lame of foot;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Compare it with the foot of Philoctetes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And make no more complaint. But you are old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old and unfortunate; consult Oëneus;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hear what a king endur’d, and learn content.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sum up your miseries, number up your sighs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tragic stage shall give you tear for tear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wash out all afflictions but its own.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following fragment from Diphilus conveys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
a very favourable idea of the spirit of the
dialogue, in what has been termed the New
Comedy of the Greeks, or that which was
posterior to the age of Alexander the Great.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Of this period Diphilus and Menander were
among the most shining ornaments.</p>

<p>Of equal merit with these two last specimens,
are the greatest part of those translations given

Greek dramatists. The literary world owes to
that ingenious writer a very high obligation for
his excellent view of the progress of the dramatic
art among the Greeks, and for the collection he
has made of the remains of more than fifty of
their comic poets.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="subhead">LIMITATION OF THE RULE REGARDING THE
IMITATION OF STYLE.—THIS IMITATION
MUST BE REGULATED BY THE GENIUS OF
LANGUAGES.—THE LATIN ADMITS OF A
GREATER BREVITY OF EXPRESSION THAN
THE ENGLISH;—AS DOES THE FRENCH.—THE
LATIN AND GREEK ALLOW GREATER
INVERSIONS THAN THE ENGLISH,—AND
ADMIT MORE FREELY OF ELLIPSIS</p>

</div>

<p>The rule which enjoins to a translator the
imitation of the style of the original author,
demands several limitations.</p>

<p>1. This imitation must always be regulated by
the nature or genius of the languages of the
original and of the translation.</p>

<p>The Latin language admits of a brevity, which
cannot be successfully imitated in the English.</p>

<p>Cicero thus writes to Trebatius (lib. 7, ep. 17):</p>

<p><i>In Britanniam te profectum non esse gaudeo,
quod et tu labore caruisti, et ego te de rebus illis
non audiam.</i></p>

<p>It is impossible to translate this into English
with equal brevity, and at the same time do complete
justice to the sentiment. Melmoth, therefore,
has shewn great judgement in sacrificing
the imitation of style to the perfect transfusion
of the sense. “I am glad, for my sake as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
as yours, that you did not attend Cæsar into
Britain; as it has not only saved you the fatigue
of a very disagreeable journey, but me likewise
that of being the perpetual auditor of your
wonderful exploits.” <i>Melm. Cic. Lett.</i> b. 2, l. 12.</p>

<p>Pliny to Minutianus, lib. 3, ep. 9, says,
towards the end of his letter: <i>Temerè dixi—Succurrit
quod præterieram, et quidem serò: sed
quanquam preposterè reddetur. Facit hoc Homerus,
multique illius exemplo. Est alioqui perdecorum:
a me tamen non ideo fiet.</i> It is no doubt possible
to translate this passage into English with a
conciseness almost equal to the original; but in
this experiment we must sacrifice all its ease
and spirit. “I have said this rashly—I recollect
an omission—somewhat too late indeed. It
shall now be supplied, though a little preposterously.
Homer does this: and many after
his example. Besides, it is not unbecoming;
but this is not my reason.” Let us mark how
Mr. Melmoth, by a happy amplification, has
preserved the spirit and ease, though sacrificing
the brevity of the original. “But upon recollection,
I find that I must recall that last
word; for I perceive, a little too late indeed,
that I have omitted a material circumstance.
However, I will mention it here, though something
out of its place. In this, I have the
authority of Homer, and several other great
names, to keep me in countenance; and the
critics will tell you this irregular manner has its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
beauties: but, upon my word, it is a beauty I
had not at all in my view.”</p>

<p>An example of a similar brevity of expression,
which admits of no imitation in English, occurs
in another letter of Cicero to Trebatius, <i>Ep.</i> l. 7,
14.</p>

<p><i>Chrysippus Vettius, Cyri architecti libertus,
fecit, ut te non immemorem putarem mei. Valde
jam lautus es qui gravere literas ad me dare,
homini præsertim domestico. Quod si scribere
oblitus es, minus multi jam te advocato causâ
cadent. Sin nostri oblitus es, dabo operam ut
isthuc veniam antequam planè ex animo tuo effluo.</i></p>

<p>In translating this passage, Mr. Melmoth has
shewn equal judgement. Without attempting to
imitate the brevity of the original, which he
knew to be impossible, he saw that the
characterising features of the passage were
ease and vivacity; and these he has very happily
transfused into his translation.</p>

<p>“If it were not for the compliments you sent
me by Chrysippus, the freedman of Cyrus the
architect, I should have imagined I no longer
possessed a place in your thoughts. But surely
you are become a most intolerable fine gentleman,
that you could not bear the fatigue of
writing to me, when you had the opportunity of
doing so by a man, whom, you know, I look
upon as one almost of my own family. Perhaps,
however, you may have forgotten the use of
your pen: and so much the better, let me tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
you, for your clients, as they will lose no more
causes by its blunders. But if it is myself only
that has escaped your remembrance, I must
endeavour to refresh it by a visit, before I am
worn out of your memory, beyond all power of
recollection.”</p>

<p>Numberless instances of a similar exercise of
judgement and of good taste are to be found in
Mr. Murphy’s excellent translation of Tacitus.
After the death of Germanicus, poisoned, as was
suspected, by Piso, with the tacit approbation of
Tiberius, the public loudly demanded justice
against the supposed murderer, and the cause
was solemnly tried in the Roman Senate. Piso,
foreseeing a judgement against him, chose to
anticipate his fate by a voluntary death. The
senate decreed that his family name should be
abolished for ever, and that his brother Marcus
should be banished from his country for ten
years; but in deference to the solicitations of the
Empress, they granted a free pardon to Plancina,
his widow. Tacitus proceeds to relate, that this
sentence of the senate was altered by Tiberius:
<i>Multa ex ea sententia mitigata sunt a principe;
“ne nomen Pisonis fastis eximeretur, quando
M. Antonii, qui bellum patriæ fecisset, Juli
Antonii, qui domum Augusti violasset, manerent;”
et M. Pisonem ignominiæ exemit, concessitque ei
paterna bona; satis firmus, ut sæpe memoravi,
adversus pecuniam; et tum pudore absolutæ
Plancinæ placabilior. Atque idem cum Valerius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Messalinus signum aureum in æde Martis Ultoris,
Cæcina Severus aram ultioni statuendam censuissent,
prohibuit: ob externas ea victorias
sacrari dictitans, domestica mala tristitia operienda.</i>
An. l. 3, c. 18.</p>

<p>Thus necessarily amplified, and translated with
the ease of original composition, by Mr. Murphy:</p>

<p>“This sentence, in many particulars, was
mitigated by Tiberius. The family name, he
said, ought not to be abolished, while that of
Mark Antony, who appeared in arms against his
country, as well as that of Julius Antonius, who
by his intrigues dishonoured the house of
Augustus, subsisted still, and figured in the
Roman annals. Marcus Piso was left in possession
of his civil dignities, and his father’s
fortune. Avarice, as has been already observed,
was not the passion of Tiberius. On this occasion,
the disgrace incurred by the partiality
shewn to Plancina, softened his temper, and
made him the more willing to extend his mercy
to the son. Valerius Messalinus moved, that a
golden statue might be erected in the temple of
Mars the Avenger. An altar to Vengeance was
proposed by Cæcina Severus. Both these
motions were over-ruled by the Emperor. The
principle on which he argued was, that public
monuments, however proper in cases of foreign
conquest, were not suited to the present juncture.
Domestic calamity should be lamented,
and as soon as possible consigned to oblivion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>The conclusion of the same chapter affords
an example yet more striking of the same
necessary and happy amplification by the
translator.</p>

<p><i>Addiderat Messalinus, Tiberio et Augustæ, et
Antoniæ, et Agrippinæ, Drusoque, ob vindictam
Germanici grates agendas, omiseratque Claudii
mentionem; et Messalinum quidem L. Asprenas
senatu coram percunctatus est, an prudens præterîsset?
Actum demum nomen Claudii adscriptum
est. Mihi quanto plura recentium, seu veterum
revolvo, tanto magis ludibria rerum mortalium
cunctis in negotiis obversantur; quippe fama, spe,
veneratione potius omnes destinabantur imperio,
quam quem futurum principem fortuna in occulto
tenebat.</i></p>

<p>“Messalinus added to his motion a vote of
thanks to Tiberius and Livia, to Antonia,
Agrippina, and Drusus, for their zeal in bringing
to justice the enemies of Germanicus. The
name of Claudius was not mentioned. Lucius
Asprenas desired to know whether that omission
was intended. The consequence was, that
Claudius was inserted in the vote. Upon an
occasion like this, it is impossible not to pause
for a moment, to make a reflection that naturally
rises out of the subject. When we review what
has been doing in the world, is it not evident,
that in all transactions, whether of ancient or of
modern date, some strange caprice of fortune
turns all human wisdom to a jest? In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
juncture before us, Claudius figured so little on the
stage of public business, that there was scarce a
man in Rome, who did not seem, by the voice of
fame and the wishes of the people, designed for
the sovereign power, rather than the very person,
whom fate, in that instant, cherished in obscurity,
to make him, at a future period, master of the
Roman world.”</p>

<p>So likewise in the following passage, we must
admire the judgement of the translator in
abandoning all attempt to rival the brevity
of the original, since he knew it could not be
attained but with the sacrifice both of ease and
perspicuity:</p>

<p><i>Is finis fuit ulciscenda Germanici morte, non
modo apud illos homines qui tum agebant, etiam
secutis temporibus vario rumore jactata; adeo
maxima quæque ambigua sunt, dum alii quoquo
modo audita pro compertis habent; alii vera in
contrarium vertunt; et gliscit utrumque posteritate.</i>
An. l. 3, c. 19.</p>

<p>“In this manner ended the enquiry concerning
the death of Germanicus; a subject which has
been variously represented, not only by men of
that day, but by all subsequent writers. It
remains, to this hour, the problem of history. A
cloud for ever hangs over the most important
transactions; while, on the one hand, credulity
adopts for fact the report of the day; and, on
the other, politicians warp and disguise the
truth: between both parties two different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
accounts go down from age to age, and gain
strength with posterity.”</p>

<p>The French language admits of a brevity of
expression more corresponding to that of the
Latin: and of this D’Alembert has given many
happy examples in his translations from Tacitus.</p>

<p><i>Quod si vita suppeditet, principatum divi
Nervæ et imperium Trajani, uberiorem, securioremque
materiam senectuti seposui: rarâ temporum
felicitate, ubi sentire quæ velis, et quæ sentias
dicere licet</i>, Praef. ad Hist. “Si les dieux m’accordent
des jours, je destine à l’occupation et à
la consolation de ma vieillesse, l’histoire interessante
et tranquille de Nerva et de Trajan; tems
heureux et rares, où l’on est libre de penser et de
parler.”</p>

<p>And with equal, perhaps superior felicity, the
same passage is thus translated by Rousseau:
“Que s’il me reste assez de vie, je réserve pour
ma vieillesse la riche et paisible matiere des
regnes de Nerva et de Trajan: rares et heureux
tems, où l’on peut penser librement, et dire ce
que l’on pense.”</p>

<p>But D’Alembert, from too earnest a desire to
imitate the conciseness of his original, has sometimes
left the sense imperfect. Of this an
example occurs in the passage before quoted,
<i>An.</i> l. 1, c. 2. <i>Cum cæteri nobilium, quanto quis
servitio promptior, opibus et honoribus extollerentur</i>:
the translator, too studious of brevity,
has not given the complete idea of his author,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
“Le reste des nobles trouvoit dans les richesses
et dans les honneurs la récompense de l’esclavage.”
<i>Omnium consensu capax imperii nisi
imperasset</i>, Tac. Hist. 1, 49. “Digne de l’empire
au jugement de tout le monde tant qu’il ne regna
pas.” This is not the idea of the author; for
Tacitus does not mean to say that Galba was
judged worthy of the empire till he attained to
it; but that all the world would have thought
him worthy of the empire if he had never
attained to it.</p>

<p>2. The Latin and Greek languages admit of
inversions which are inconsistent with the genius
of the English.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon, injudiciously aiming at an imitation
of the Latin construction, has given a
barbarous air to his translation of Tacitus:
“To Pallas, who was by Claudius declared to
be the deviser of this scheme, the ornaments of
the prætorship, and three hundred seventy-five
thousand crowns, were adjudged by Bareas
Soranus, consul designed,” <i>An.</i> b. 12.—“Still
to be seen are the Roman standards in the
German groves, there, by me, hung up,” <i>An.</i>
lib. 1. “Naturally violent was the spirit of
Arminius, and now, by the captivity of his wife,
and by the fate of his child, doomed to bondage
though yet unborn, enraged even to distraction.”
<i>Ib.</i> “But he, the more ardent he found the
affections of the soldiers, and the greater the
hatred of his uncle, so much the more intent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
upon a decisive victory, weighed with himself all
the methods,” &amp;c. <i>Ib.</i> lib. 2.</p>

<p>Thus, Mr. Macpherson, in his translation of
Homer, (a work otherwise valuable, as containing
a most perfect transfusion of the sense of his
author), has generally adopted an inverted construction,
which is incompatible with the genius
of the English language. “Tlepolemus, the race
of Hercules,—brave in battle and great in arms,
nine ships led to Troy, with magnanimous
Rhodians filled. Those who dwelt in Rhodes,
distinguished in nations three,—who held Lindus,
Ialyssus, and white Camirus, beheld him afar.—Their
leader in arms was Tlepolemus, renowned
at the spear, <i>Il.</i> l. 2.—The heroes the slaughter
began.—Alexander first a warrior slew.—Through
the neck, by the helm passed the
steel.—Iphinous, the son of Dexius, through
the shoulder he pierced—to the earth fell the
chief in his blood, <i>Ib.</i> l. 7. Not unjustly we
Hector admire; matchless at launching the
spear; to break the line of battle, bold, <i>Ib.</i> l. 5.
Nor for vows unpaid rages Apollo; nor solemn
sacrifice denied,” <i>Ib.</i> l. 1.</p>

<p>3. The English language is not incapable of
an elliptical mode of expression; but it does not
admit of it to the same degree as the Latin.
Tacitus says, <i>Trepida civitas incusare Tiberium</i>,
for <i>trepida civitas incepit incusare Tiberium</i>. We
cannot say in English, “The terrified city to
blame Tiberius:” And even as Gordon has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
translated these words, the ellipsis is too violent
for the English language; “hence against
Tiberius many complaints.”</p>

<p class="subhead">WHETHER A POEM CAN BE WELL TRANSLATED
INTO PROSE</p>

</div>

<p>From all the preceding observations respecting
the imitation of style, we may derive this
precept, That a Translator ought always to figure
to himself, in what manner the original author
would have expressed himself, if he had written
in the language of the translation.</p>

<p>This precept leads to the examination, and
probably to the decision, of a question which has
admitted of some dispute, Whether a poem can
be well translated into prose?</p>

<p>There are certain species of poetry, of which
the chief merit consists in the sweetness and
melody of the versification. Of these it is
evident, that the very essence must perish in
translating them into prose. What should we
find in the following beautiful lines, when divested
of the melody of verse?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She said, and melting as in tears she lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a soft silver stream dissolved away.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">For ever murmurs, and for ever weeps;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still bears the name the hapless virgin bore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bathes the forest where she rang’d before.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Pope’s</span> <i>Windsor Forest</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But a great deal of the beauty of every regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
poem, consists in the melody of its numbers.
Sensible of this truth, many of the prose translators
of poetry, have attempted to give a sort
of measure to their prose, which removes it from
the nature of ordinary language. If this measure
is uniform, and its return regular, the composition
is no longer prose, but blank-verse. If it is
not uniform, and does not regularly return upon
the ear, the composition will be more unharmonious,
than if the measure had been entirely
neglected. Of this, Mr. Macpherson’s translation
of the <i>Iliad</i> is a strong example.</p>

<p>But it is not only by the measure that poetry
is distinguishable from prose. It is by the
character of its thoughts and sentiments, and
by the nature of that language in which they are
clothed.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> A boldness of figures, a luxuriancy of
imagery, a frequent use of metaphors, a quickness
of transition, a liberty of digressing; all
these are not only <i>allowable</i> in poetry, but to many
species of it, <i>essential</i>. But they are quite unsuitable
to the character of prose. When seen
in a <i>prose translation</i>, they appear preposterous
and out of place, because they are never found
in an <i>original prose composition</i>.</p>

<p>In opposition to these remarks, it may be
urged, that there are examples of poems originally
composed in prose, as Fenelon’s <i>Telemachus</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
But to this we answer, that Fenelon, in composing
his <i>Telemachus</i>, has judiciously adopted
nothing more of the characteristics of poetry
than what might safely be given to a prose composition.
His good taste prescribed to him
certain limits, which he was under no necessity
of transgressing. But a translator is not left to
a similar freedom of judgement: he must follow
the footsteps of his original. Fenelon’s <i>Epic
Poem</i> is of a very different character from the
<i>Iliad</i>, the <i>Æneid</i>, or the <i>Gierusalemme Liberata</i>.
The French author has, in the conduct of his
fable, seldom transgressed the bounds of historic
probability; he has sparingly indulged himself
in the use of the Epic machinery; and there is
a chastity and sobriety even in his language,
very different from the glowing enthusiasm that
characterises the diction of the poems we have
mentioned: We find nothing in the <i>Telemaque</i>
of the <i>Os magna sonaturum</i>.</p>

<p>The difficulty of translating poetry into prose,
is different in its degree, according to the nature
or species of the poem. Didactic poetry, of
which the principal merit consists in the detail
of a regular system, or in rational precepts which
flow from each other in a connected train of
thought, will evidently suffer least by being
transfused into prose. But every didactic poet
judiciously enriches his work with such ornaments
as are not strictly attached to his subject.
In a prose translation of such a poem, all that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
is strictly systematic or preceptive may be
transfused with propriety; all the rest, which
belongs to embellishment, will be found impertinent
and out of place. Of this we have a
convincing proof in Dryden’s translation of the
valuable poem of Du Fresnoy, <i>De Arte Graphica</i>.
The didactic parts of the poem are translated
with becoming propriety; but in the midst of
those practical instructions in the art of painting,
how preposterous appear in prose such passages
as the following?</p>

<p>“Those things which the poets have thought
unworthy of their pens, the painters have judged
to be unworthy of their pencils. For both those
arts, that they might advance the sacred honours
of religion, have raised themselves to heaven;
and having found a free admission into the
palace of Jove himself, have enjoyed the sight
and conversation of the Gods, whose awful
majesty they observe, and whose dictates they
communicate to mankind, whom, at the same
time they inspire with those celestial flames
which shine so gloriously in their works.</p>

<p>“Besides all this, you are to express the
motions of the spirits, and the affections or passions,
whose centre is the heart. This is that in
which the greatest difficulty consists. Few there
are whom Jupiter regards with a favourable eye
in this undertaking.</p>

<p>“And as this part, (the Art of Colouring),
which we may call the utmost perfection of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Painting, is a deceiving beauty, but withal
soothing and pleasing; so she has been accused
of procuring lovers for her sister (Design), and
artfully engaging us to admire her.”</p>

<p>But there are certain species of poetry, of the
merits of which it will be found impossible to
convey the smallest idea in a prose translation.
Such is Lyric poetry, where a greater degree of
irregularity of thought, and a more unrestrained
exuberance of fancy, is allowable than in any
other species of composition. To attempt,
therefore, a translation of a lyric poem into
prose, is the most absurd of all undertakings;
for those very characters of the original which
are essential to it, and which constitute its highest
beauties, if transferred to a prose translation, become
unpardonable blemishes. The excursive
range of the sentiments, and the play of fancy,
which we admire in the original, degenerate in
the translation into mere raving and impertinence.
Of this the translation of Horace in prose, by
Smart, furnishes proofs in every page.</p>

<p>We may certainly, from the foregoing observations,
conclude, that it is impossible to do
complete justice to any species of poetical composition
in a prose translation; in other words,
that none but a poet can translate a poet.</p>

<p class="subhead">THIRD GENERAL RULE—A TRANSLATION
SHOULD HAVE ALL THE EASE OF ORIGINAL

IN THE OBSERVANCE OF THIS
RULE.—CONTRASTED INSTANCES OF SUCCESS
AND FAILURE.—OF THE NECESSITY
OF SOMETIMES SACRIFICING ONE RULE
TO ANOTHER</p>

</div>

<p>It remains now that we consider the third
general law of translation.</p>

<p>In order that the merit of the original work
may be so completely transfused as to produce
its full effect, it is necessary, not only that the
translation should contain a perfect transcript of
the sentiments of the original, and present likewise
a resemblance of its style and manner; but,
That the translation should have all the ease of
original composition.</p>

<p>When we consider those restraints within
which a translator finds himself necessarily confined,
with regard to the sentiments and manner
of his original, it will soon appear that this last
requisite includes the most difficult part of his
task.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> To one who walks in trammels, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
easy to exhibit an air of grace and freedom. It
is difficult, even for a capital painter, to preserve
in a copy of a picture all the ease and spirit of
the original; yet the painter employs precisely
the same colours, and has no other care than
faithfully to imitate the touch and manner of the
picture that is before him. If the original is
easy and graceful, the copy will have the same
qualities, in proportion as the imitation is just
and perfect. The translator’s task is very different:
He uses not the same colours with the
original, but is required to give his picture the
same force and effect. He is not allowed to
copy the touches of the original, yet is required,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
by touches of his own, to produce a perfect
resemblance. The more he studies a scrupulous
imitation, the less his copy will reflect the ease
and spirit of the original. How then shall a
translator accomplish this difficult union of ease
with fidelity? To use a bold expression, he
must adopt the very soul of his author, which
must speak through his own organs.</p>

<p>Let us proceed to exemplify this third rule of
translation, which regards the attainment of ease
of style, by instances both of success and failure.</p>

<p>The familiar style of epistolary correspondence
is rarely attainable even in original composition.
It consists in a delicate medium between the perfect
freedom of ordinary conversation and the
regularity of written dissertation or narrative.
It is extremely difficult to attain this delicate
medium in a translation; because the writer has
neither a freedom of choice in the sentiments,
nor in the mode of expressing them. Mr. Melmoth
appears to me to be a great model in this
respect. His Translations of the <i>Epistles of
Cicero</i> and of Pliny have all the ease of the
originals, while they present in general a very
faithful transcript of his author’s sense.</p>

<p>“Surely, <i>my friend</i>, your couriers are <i>a set of the
most unconscionable fellows</i>. <i>Not that they have
given</i> me any particular offence; but as they never
bring me a letter when they arrive here, <i>is it fair</i>,
they should always press me for one when they
return?” Melmoth, <i>Cic. Ep.</i> 10, 20.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p><i>Præposteros habes tabellarios; etsi me quidem
non offendunt. Sed tamen cum a me discedunt,
flagitant litteras, cum ad me veniunt, nullas
afferunt.</i> Cic. Ep. l. 15, ep. 17.</p>

<p>“Is it not more worthy of your <i>mighty</i> ambition,
to be blended with your learned brethren
at Rome, than to stand <i>the sole great wonder of
wisdom</i> amidst a <i>parcel of paltry provincials</i>?”
Melmoth, <i>Cic. Ep.</i> 2, 23.</p>

<p><i>Velim—ibi malis esse ubi aliquo numero sis,
quam isthic ubi solus sapere videare.</i> Cic. Ep.
l. 1, ep. 10.</p>

<p>“<i>In short</i>, I plainly perceive your <i>finances</i> are
in no flourishing situation, and I expect to hear
the same account of all your neighbours; so that
famine, <i>my friend, most formidable famine</i>, must
be your <i>fate</i>, if you do not provide against it in
due time. And since you have been reduced to
sell your horse, <i>e’en mount</i> your mule, (the only
animal, <i>it seems</i>, belonging to you, which you
have not yet <i>sacrificed to your table</i>), and <i>convey
yourself</i> immediately to Rome. <i>To encourage
you to do so</i>, you shall be honoured with a chair
and cushion next to mine, and sit the second
<i>great pedagogue</i> in my <i>celebrated</i> school.” Melmoth,
<i>Cic. Ep.</i> 8, 22.</p>

<p><i>Video te bona perdidisse: spero idem isthuc
familiares tuos. Actum igitur de te est, nisi provides.
Potes mulo isto quem tibi reliquum dicis
esse (quando cantherium comedisti) Romam pervehi.
Sella tibi erit in ludo, tanquam hypodidascalo;
proxima eam pulvinus sequetur.</i> Cic.
Ep. l. 9, ep. 18.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“Are you not a <i>pleasant mortal</i>, to question me
concerning the fate of those estates you mention,
when Balbus had just before been <i>paying you a
visit</i>?” Melmoth, <i>Cic. Ep.</i> 8, 24.</p>

<p><i>Non tu homo ridiculus es, qui cum Balbus
noster apud te fuerit, ex me quæras quid de istis
municipiis et agris futurum putem?</i> Cic. Ep. 9,
17.</p>

<p>“<i>And now</i> I have raised your expectations of
this piece, <i>I doubt</i> you will be disappointed when
<i>it comes to your hands</i>. In the meanwhile, however,
you may expect it, as something that will
please you: <i>And who knows but it may?</i>” Plin.
Ep. 8, 3.</p>

<p><i>Erexi expectationem tuam; quam vereor ne
destituat oratio in manus sumpta. Interim tamen,
tanquam placituram, et fortasse placebit, expecta.</i>
Plin. Ep. 8, 3.</p>

<p>“I consent to undertake the cause which you
so earnestly recommend to me; but <i>as glorious
and honourable as it may be, I will not be your
counsel without a fee</i>. Is it possible, you will say,
that <i>my friend Pliny</i> should be so mercenary?
<i>In truth it is</i>; and <i>I insist upon</i> a reward, which
will do me more honour than the most disinterested
patronage.” <i>Plin. Ep.</i> 6, 23.</p>

<p><i>Impense petis ut agam causam pertinentem
ad curam tuam, pulchram alioquin et famosam.
Faciam, sed non gratis. Qui fieri potest (inquis)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
ut non gratis tu? Potest: exigam enim mercedem
honestiorem gratuito patrocinio.</i> Plin. Ep. 8, 3.</p>

<p>To these examples of the ease of epistolary
correspondence, I add a passage from one of the
orations of Cicero, which is yet in a strain of
greater familiarity: “A certain mechanic—<i>What’s
his name?—Oh, I’m obliged to you for
helping me to it</i>: Yes, I mean Polycletus.”
Melmoth.</p>

<p><i>Artificem—quemnam? Recte admones. Polycletum
esse ducebant.</i> Cicero, Orat. 2, in Verrem.</p>

<p>In the preceding instances from Mr. Melmoth,
the words of the English translation which are
marked in Italics, are those which, in my opinion,
give it the ease of original composition.</p>

<p>But while a translator thus endeavours to
transfuse into his work all the ease of the
original, the most correct taste is requisite to
prevent that ease from degenerating into licentiousness.
I have, in treating of the imitation
of style and manner, given some examples of
the want of this taste. The most licentious of
all translators was Mr. Thomas Brown, of facetious
memory, in whose translations from Lucian
we have the most perfect ease; but it is the ease
of Billingsgate and of Wapping. I shall contrast
a few passages of his translation of this author,
with those of another translator, who has given
a faithful transcript of the sense of his original,
but from an over-scrupulous fidelity has failed a
little in point of ease.</p>

all he appears so demure now, that you’d think

<p>“Straight he changes his name, so that the
rascal, who the moment before had no other title
about the house, but, you son of a whore, you
bulk-begotten cur, you scoundrel, must now be
called his worship, his excellency, and the Lord
knows what. The best on’t is, that this mushroom
puts all these fellows noses out of joint,”
&amp;c. Dryden’s <i>Lucian</i>, <i>Timon</i>.</p>

<p>From these contrasted specimens we may
decide, that the one translation of Lucian errs
perhaps as much on the score of restraint, as
the other on that of licentiousness. The preceding
examples from Melmoth point out, in
my opinion, the just medium of free and spirited
translation, for the attainment of which the most
correct taste is requisite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>If the order in which I have classed the three
general laws of translation is their just and
natural arrangement, which I think will hardly
be denied, it will follow, that in all cases where
a sacrifice is necessary to be made of one of
those laws to another, a due regard ought to be
paid to their rank and comparative importance.
The different genius of the languages of the
original and translation, will often make it
necessary to depart from the manner of the
original, in order to convey a faithful picture
of the sense; but it would be highly preposterous
to depart, in any case, from the sense, for the
sake of imitating the manner. Equally improper
would it be, to sacrifice either the sense or
manner of the original, if these can be preserved
consistently with purity of expression, to a
fancied ease or superior gracefulness of composition.
This last is the fault of the French
translations of D’Ablancourt, an author otherwise
of very high merit. His versions are admirable,
so long as we forbear to compare them with the
originals; they are models of ease, of elegance,
and perspicuity; but he has considered these
qualities as the primary requisites of translation,
and both the sense and manner of his
originals are sacrificed, without scruple, to their
attainment.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p class="subhead">IT IS LESS DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN THE EASE OF
ORIGINAL COMPOSITION IN POETICAL, THAN
IN PROSE TRANSLATION.—LYRIC POETRY
ADMITS OF THE GREATEST LIBERTY OF
TRANSLATION.—EXAMPLES DISTINGUISHING
PARAPHRASE FROM TRANSLATION,—FROM
DRYDEN, LOWTH, FONTENELLE,

</div>

<p>It may perhaps appear paradoxical to assert,
that it is less difficult to give to a poetical
translation all the ease of original composition,
than to give the same degree of ease to a prose
translation. Yet the truth of this assertion
will be readily admitted, if assent is given to that
observation, which I before endeavoured to illustrate,
viz. That a superior degree of liberty is
allowed to a poetical translator in amplifying,
retrenching from, and embellishing his original,
than to a prose translator. For without some
portion of this liberty, there can be no ease of
composition; and where the greatest liberty is
allowable, there that ease will be most apparent,
as it is less difficult to attain to it.</p>

<p>For the same reason, among the different
species of poetical composition, the lyric is that
which allows of the greatest liberty in translation;
as a freedom both of thought and expression
is agreeable to its character. Yet even in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
this, which is the freest of all species of translation,
we must guard against licentiousness; and
perhaps the more so, that we are apt to persuade
ourselves that the less caution is necessary. The
difficulty indeed is, where so much freedom is
allowed, to define what is to be accounted
licentiousness in poetical translation. A moderate
liberty of amplifying and retrenching the
ideas of the original, has been granted to the
translator of prose; but is it allowable, even to
the translator of a lyric poem, to add new
images and new thoughts to those of the original,
or to enforce the sentiments by illustrations
which are not in the original? As the limits
between free translation and paraphrase are
more easily perceived than they can be well
defined, instead of giving a general answer to
this question, I think it safer to give my opinion
upon particular examples.</p>

<p>Dr. Lowth has adapted to the present times,
and addressed to his own countrymen, a very
noble imitation of the 6th ode of the third book
of Horace: <i>Delicta majorum immeritus lues</i>, &amp;c.
The greatest part of this composition is of the
nature of parody; but in the version of the
following stanza there is perhaps but a slight
excess of that liberty which may be allowed to
the translator of a lyric poet:</p>

<p>Here the translator has superadded no new
images or illustrations; but he has, in two parts
of the stanza, given a moral application which is
not in the original: “That ill adorns the form,
while it corrupts the heart;” and “Studious of
every praise, but virtue, truth, and sense.” These
moral lines are unquestionably a very high
improvement of the original; but they seem to
me to transgress, though indeed very slightly, the
liberty allowed to a poetical translator.</p>

<p>The following verses by Prior are certainly a
great improvement upon the original; by a most

<p>Mr. Pope’s <i>Dying Christian to his Soul</i>,
which is modelled on the verses of Adrian,
retains so little of the thoughts of the original,

so different, that it cannot even be called
a <i>paraphrase</i>, but falls rather under the description
of <i>imitation</i>.</p>

<p>The Italian version of <i>Ovid</i> in <i>ottava rima</i>,

<p>In the following poem by Mr. Hughes, which
the author has intitled an imitation of the 16th ode

of the composition is a just and excellent translation,
while the rest is a free paraphrase or commentary

<p class="subhead">OF THE TRANSLATION OF IDIOMATIC PHRASES.—EXAMPLES
FROM COTTON, ECHARD,
STERNE.—INJUDICIOUS USE OF IDIOMS IN
THE TRANSLATION, WHICH DO NOT CORRESPOND
WITH THE AGE OR COUNTRY OF THE
ORIGINAL.—IDIOMATIC PHRASES SOMETIMES
INCAPABLE OF TRANSLATION.</p>

</div>

<p>While a translator endeavours to give to his
work all the ease of original composition, the
chief difficulty he has to encounter will be found
in the translation of idioms, or those turns of
expression which do not belong to universal
grammar, but of which every language has its
own, that are exclusively proper to it. It will
be easily understood, that when I speak of the
difficulty of translating idioms, I do not mean
those general modes of arrangement or construction
which regulate a whole language, and
which may not be common to it with other
tongues: As, for example, the placing the adjective
always before the substantive in English,
which in French and in Latin is most commonly
placed after it; the use of the participle in
English, where the present tense is used in other
languages; as he is writing, <i>scribit</i>, <i>il écrit</i>; the
use of the preposition <i>to</i> before the infinitive in
English, where the French use the preposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
<i>de</i> or <i>of</i>. These, which may be termed the
<i>general</i> idioms of a language, are soon understood,
and are exchanged for parallel idioms
with the utmost ease. With regard to these a
translator can never err, unless through affectation
or choice.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> For example, in translating the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
French phrase, <i>Il profita d’un avis</i>, he may
choose fashionably to say, in violation of the
English construction, <i>he profited</i> of <i>an advice</i>; or,
under the sanction of poetical licence, he may
choose to engraft the idiom of one language
into another, as Mr. Macpherson has done, where
he says, “Him to <i>the strength of Hercules</i>, the
lovely Astyochea bore;” Ον τεκεν Αστυοχεια, βιη
Ηρακληειη· <i>Il.</i> lib. 2, l. 165. But it is not with
regard to such idiomatic constructions, that a
translator will ever find himself under any
difficulty. It is in the translation of those
particular idiomatic phrases of which every
language has its own collection; phrases which
are generally of a familiar nature, and which
occur most commonly in conversation, or in that
species of writing which approaches to the ease
of conversation.</p>

<p>The translation is perfect, when the translator
finds in his own language an idiomatic phrase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
corresponding to that of the original. Montaigne
(<i>Ess.</i> l. 1, c. 29) says of Gallio, “Lequel
ayant été envoyé en exil en l’isle de Lesbos, on
fut averti à Rome, <i>qu’il s’y donnoit du bon temps</i>,
et que ce qu’on lui avoit enjoint pour peine, lui
tournoit à commodité.” The difficulty of translating
this sentence lies in the idiomatic phrase,
“<i>qu’il s’y donnoit du bon temps</i>.” Cotton finding
a parallel idiom in English, has translated the
passage with becoming ease and spirit: “As it
happened to one Gallio, who having been sent
an exile to the isle of Lesbos, news was not long
after brought to Rome, that <i>he there lived as
merry as the day was long</i>; and that what had
been enjoined him for a penance, turned out to
his greatest pleasure and satisfaction.” Thus,
in another passage of the same author, (<i>Essais</i>,
l. 1, c. 29) “<i>Si j’eusse été chef de part</i>, j’eusse
prins autre voye plus naturelle.” “<i>Had I rul’d
the roast</i>, I should have taken another and more
natural course.” So likewise, (<i>Ess.</i> l. 1, c. 25)
“Mais d’y enfoncer plus avant, et de <i>m’être rongé
les ongles à l’étude d’Aristote</i>, monarche de la
doctrine moderne.” “But, to dive farther than
that, and to have <i>cudgell’d my brains in the study
of Aristotle</i>, the monarch of all modern learning.”
So, in the following passages from Terence,
translated by Echard: “<i>Credo manibus pedibusque
obnixè omnia facturum</i>,” Andr. act 1. “I
know he’ll be at it tooth and nail.” “<i>Herus,
quantum audio, uxore excidit</i>,” Andr. act 2.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
“For aught I perceive, my poor master may go
whistle for a wife.”</p>

<p>In like manner, the following colloquial
phrases are capable of a perfect translation by
corresponding idioms. <i>Rem acu tetigisti</i>, “You
have hit the nail upon the head.” <i>Mihi isthic
nec seritur nec repitur</i>, Plaut. “That’s no bread
and butter of mine.” <i>Omnem jecit aleam</i>, “It
was neck or nothing with him.” Τι προς τ’
αλφιτα; Aristoph. <i>Nub.</i> “Will that make the
pot boil?”</p>

<p>It is not perhaps possible to produce a happier
instance of translation by corresponding idioms,
than Sterne has given in the translation of
<i>Slawkenbergius’s Tale</i>. “<i>Nihil me pœnitet hujus
nasi</i>, quoth Pamphagus; that is, My nose has
been the making of me.” “<i>Nec est cur pœniteat</i>;
that is, How the deuce should such a nose fail?”
<i>Tristram Shandy</i>, vol. 3, ch. 7. “<i>Miles peregrini
in faciem suspexit. Dî boni, nova forma nasi!</i>
The centinel look’d up into the stranger’s face.—Never
saw such a nose in his life!” <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>As there is nothing which so much conduces
both to the ease and spirit of composition, as a
happy use of idiomatic phrases, there is nothing
which a translator, who has a moderate command
of his own language, is so apt to carry to
a licentious extreme. Echard, whose translations
of <i>Terence</i> and of <i>Plautus</i> have, upon the
whole, much merit, is extremely censurable for
his intemperate use of idiomatic phrases. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
the first act of the <i>Andria</i>, Davus thus speaks to
himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Enimvero, Dave, nihil loci est segnitiæ neque socordiæ.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Quantum intellexi senis sententiam de nuptiis:</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Quæ si non astu providentur, me aut herum pessundabunt;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Nec quid agam certum est, Pamphilumne adjutem an auscultem seni.</i></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Terent.</span> <i>Andr.</i> act 1, sc. 3.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The translation of this passage by Echard,
exhibits a strain of vulgar petulance, which is
very opposite to the chastened simplicity of the
original.</p>

<p>“Why, seriously, poor Davy, ’tis high time to
bestir thy stumps, and to leave off dozing; at
least, if a body may guess at the old man’s
meaning by his mumping. If these brains do
not help me out at a dead lift, to pot goes
Pilgarlick, or his master, for certain: and hang
me for a dog, if I know which side to take;
whether to help my young master, or make fair
with his father.”</p>

<p>In the use of idiomatic phrases, a translator
frequently forgets both the country of his original
author, and the age in which he wrote; and
while he makes a Greek or a Roman speak
French or English, he unwittingly puts into his
mouth allusions to the manners of modern
France or England.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> This, to use a phrase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
borrowed from painting, may be termed an
offence against the <i>costume</i>. The proverbial
expression, βατραχω ὑδωρ, in <i>Theocritus</i>, is of
similar import with the English proverb, <i>to carry
coals to Newcastle</i>; but it would be a gross
impropriety to use this expression in the translation
of an ancient classic. Cicero, in his oration
for Archias, says, “<i>Persona quæ propter otium et
studium minime in judiciis periculisque versata
est.</i>” M. Patru has translated this, “Un homme
que ses études et ses livres ont éloigné du
commerce du <i>Palais</i>.” The <i>Palais</i>, or the Old
Palace of the kings of France, it is true, is the
place where the parliament of Paris and the
chief courts of justice were assembled for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
the decision of causes; but it is just as absurd
to make Cicero talk of his haranguing in the
<i>Palais</i>, as it would be of his pleading in Westminster
Hall. In this respect, Echard is most
notoriously faulty: We find in every page of his
translations of <i>Terence</i> and <i>Plautus</i>, the most
incongruous jumble of ancient and of modern
manners. He talks of the “Lord Chief Justice
of Athens,” <i>Jam tu autem nobis Præturam geris?</i>
Pl. Epid. act 1, sc. 1, and says, “I will send him
to Bridewell with his skin stripped over his
ears,” <i>Hominem irrigatum plagis pistori dabo</i>,
Ibid. sc. 3. “I must expect to beat hemp in
Bridewell all the days of my life,” <i>Molendum
mihi est usque in pistrina</i>, Ter. Phormio, act 2.
“He looks as grave as an alderman,” <i>Tristis
severitas inest in vultû</i>, Ibid. Andria, act 5.—The
same author makes the ancient heathen
Romans and Greeks swear British and Christian
oaths; such as “Fore George, Blood and ounds,
Gadzookers, ’Sbuddikins, By the Lord Harry!”
They are likewise well read in the books both
of the Old and New Testament: “Good b’ye,
Sir Solomon,” says Gripus to Trachalion, <i>Salve,
Thales!</i> Pl. Rudens, act 4, sc. 3; and Sosia thus
vouches his own identity to Mercury, “By Jove
I am he, and ’tis as true as the gospel,” <i>Per
Jovem juro, med esse, neque me falsum dicere</i>,
Pl. Amphit. act 1, sc. 1.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The same ancients,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
in Mr. Echard’s translation, are familiarly acquainted
with the modern invention of gunpowder;
“Had we but a mortar now to play
upon them under the covert way, one bomb
would make them scamper,” <i>Fundam tibi nunc
nimis vellem dari, ut tu illos procul hinc ex oculto
cæderes, facerent fugam</i>, Ter. Eun. act 4. And
as their soldiers swear and fight, so they must
needs drink like the moderns: “This god can’t
afford one brandy-shop in all his dominions,”
<i>Ne thermopolium quidem ullum ille instruit</i>, Pl.
Rud. act 2, sc. 9. In the same comedy, Plautus,
who wrote 180 years before Christ, alludes to
the battle of La Hogue, fought <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1692.
“I’ll be as great as a king,” says Gripus, “I’ll
have a <i>Royal Sun</i><a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> for pleasure, like the king of
France, and sail about from port to port,”
<i>Navibus magnis mercaturam faciam</i>, Pl. Rud.
act 4, sc. 2.</p>

<p>In the Latin poems of Pitcairne, we remark
an uncommon felicity in cloathing pictures of
modern manners in classical phraseology. In
familiar poetry, and in pieces of a witty or
humorous nature, this has often a very happy
effect, and exalts the ridicule of the sentiment,
or humour of the picture. But Pitcairne’s fondness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
for the language of Horace, Ovid, and
Lucretius, has led him sometimes into a gross
violation of propriety, and the laws of good taste.
In the translation of a Psalm, we are shocked
when we find the Almighty addressed by the
epithets of a heathen divinity, and his attributes
celebrated in the language and allusions proper
to the Pagan mythology. Thus, in the translation
of the 104th Psalm, every one must be
sensible of the glaring impropriety of the
following expressions:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dexteram invictam canimus, Jovemque</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui triumphatis, hominum et Deorum</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Quam tuæ virtus tremefecit orbem</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Juppiter dextræ.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Juppiter solus mihi rex.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the entire translation of the Psalms by
Johnston, we do not find a single instance of
similar impropriety. And in the admirable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
version by Buchanan, there are (to my knowledge)
only two passages which are censurable on that
account. The one is the beginning of the 4th
Psalm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Pater, O hominum <i>Divûmque</i> æterna potestas!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which is the first line of the speech of Venus to
Jupiter, in the 10th <i>Æneid</i>: and the other is the
beginning of Psalm lxxxii. where two entire
lines, with the change of one syllable, are
borrowed from Horace:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Regum timendorum in proprios greges,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reges in ipsos imperium est <i>Jovæ</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the latter example, the poet probably judged
that the change of <i>Jovis</i> into <i>Jovæ</i> removed all
objection; and Ruddiman has attempted to
vindicate the <i>Divûm</i> of the former passage, by
applying it to saints or angels: but allowing
there were sufficient apology for both those
words, the impropriety still remains; for the
associated ideas present themselves immediately
to the mind, and we are justly offended with the
literal adoption of an address to Jupiter in a
hymn to the Creator.</p>

<p>If a translator is bound, in general, to adhere
with fidelity to the manners of the age and
country to which his original belongs, there are
some instances in which he will find it necessary
to make a slight sacrifice to the manners of his
modern readers. The ancients, in the expression
of resentment or contempt, made use of many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
epithets and appellations which sound extremely
shocking to our more polished ears, because we
never hear them employed but by the meanest
and most degraded of the populace. By similar
reasoning we must conclude, that those expressions
conveyed no such mean or shocking
ideas to the ancients, since we find them used
by the most dignified and exalted characters.
In the 19th book of the <i>Odyssey</i>, Melantho, one
of Penelope’s maids, having vented her spleen
against Ulysses, and treated him as a bold
beggar who had intruded himself into the palace
as a spy, is thus sharply reproved by the Queen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Παντως θαρσαλεη κυον αδδεες, ουτι με ληθεις</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ερδουσα μεγα εργον, ὁ ση κεφαλη αναμαξεις.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These opprobrious epithets, in a literal translation,
would sound extremely offensive from the
lips of the περιφρων Πηνελοπεια, whom the poet
has painted as a model of female dignity and
propriety. Such translation, therefore, as conveying
a picture different from what the poet
intended, would be in reality injurious to his
sense. Of this sort of refinement Mr. Hobbes
had no idea; and therefore he gives the epithets
in their genuine purity and simplicity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Bold bitch, said she, I know what deeds you’ve done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which thou shalt one day pay for with thy head.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We cannot fail, however, to perceive, that Mr.
Pope has in fact been more faithful to the sense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
of his original, by accommodating the expressions
of the speaker to that character which a
modern reader must conceive to belong to her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Loquacious insolent, she cries, forbear!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy head shall pay the forfeit of thy tongue.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A translator will often meet with idiomatic
phrases in the original author, to which no corresponding
idiom can be found in the language
of the translation. As a literal translation of
such phrases cannot be tolerated, the only resource
is, to express the sense in plain and easy
language. Cicero, in one of his letters to Papirius
Pætus, says, “<i>Veni igitur, si vires, et disce jam
προλεγομενας quas quæris; etsi sus Minervam</i>,”
Ep. ad Fam. 9, 18. The idiomatic phrase <i>si vires</i>,
is capable of a perfect translation by a corresponding
idiom; but that which occurs in the
latter part of the sentence, <i>etsi sus Minervam</i>, can
neither be translated by a corresponding idiom,
nor yet literally. Mr. Melmoth has thus happily
expressed the sense of the whole passage: “If
you have any spirit then, fly hither, and learn
from our elegant bills of fare how to refine your
own; though, to do your talents justice, this is
a sort of knowledge in which you are much
superior to your instructors.”—Pliny, in one
of his epistles to Calvisius, thus addresses him,
<i>Assem para, et accipe auream fabulam: fabulas
immo: nam me priorum nova admonuit</i>, lib. 2, ep.
20. To this expression, <i>assem para</i>, &amp;c. which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
is a proverbial mode of speech, we have nothing
that corresponds in English. To translate the
phrase literally would have a poor effect: “Give
me a penny, and take a golden story, or a story
worth gold.” Mr. Melmoth has given the sense
in easy language: “Are you inclined to hear a
story? or, if you please, two or three? for one
brings to my mind another.”</p>

<p>But this resource, of translating the idiomatic
phrase into easy language, must fail, where the
merit of the passage to be translated actually lies
in that expression which is idiomatical. This
will often occur in epigrams, many of which are
therefore incapable of translation: Thus, in the
following epigram, the point of wit lies in an
idiomatic phrase, and is lost in every other
language where the same precise idiom does not
occur:</p>

<p class="center"><i>On the wretched imitations of the</i> Diable Boiteux <i>of
Le Sage</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Le Diable Boiteux est aimable;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Le Sage y triomphe aujourdhui;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tout ce qu’on a fait après lui</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">N’a pas valu le Diable.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We say in English, “’Tis not worth a fig,” or,
“’tis not worth a farthing;” but we cannot say,
as the French do, “’Tis not worth the devil;”
and therefore the epigram cannot be translated
into English.</p>

<p>Somewhat of the same nature are the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
lines of Marot, in his <i>Epitre au Roi</i>, where
the merit lies in the ludicrous <i>naïveté</i> of the last
line, which is idiomatical, and has no strictly
corresponding expression in English:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">J’avois un jour un valet de Gascogne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gourmand, yvrogne, et assuré menteur,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pipeur, larron, jureur, blasphémateur,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sentant la hart de cent pas à la ronde:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Au demeurant le meilleur filz du monde.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Although we have idioms in English that are
nearly similar to this, we have none which
has the same <i>naïveté</i>, and therefore no justice
can be done to this passage by any English
translation.</p>

<p>In like manner, it appears to me impossible
to convey, in any translation, the <i>naïveté</i> of the
following remark on the fanciful labours of
Etymologists: “Monsieur,—dans l’Etymologie
il faut compter les voyelles pour rien, et les
consonnes pour peu de chose.”</p>

FROM ITS IDIOMATIC PHRASEOLOGY.—OF
THE BEST TRANSLATIONS OF THAT ROMANCE.—COMPARISON
OF THE TRANSLATION
BY MOTTEUX WITH THAT BY SMOLLET.</p>

</div>

<p>There is perhaps no book to which it is
more difficult to do perfect justice in a translation
than the <i>Don Quixote</i> of Cervantes. This
difficulty arises from the extreme frequency of
its idiomatic phrases. As the Spanish language
is in itself highly idiomatical, even the narrative
part of the book is on that account difficult;
but the colloquial part is studiously filled with
idioms, as one of the principal characters continually
expresses himself in proverbs. Of this work
there have been many English translations, executed,
as may be supposed, with various degrees
of merit. The two best of these, in my opinion,
are the translations of Motteux and Smollet,
both of them writers eminently well qualified
for the task they undertook. It will not be
foreign to the purpose of this Essay, if I shall
here make a short comparative estimate of the
merit of these translations.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>Smollet inherited from nature a strong sense
of ridicule, a great fund of original humour, and
a happy versatility of talent, by which he could
accommodate his style to almost every species
of writing. He could adopt alternately the
solemn, the lively, the sarcastic, the burlesque,
and the vulgar. To these qualifications he joined
an inventive genius, and a vigorous imagination.
As he possessed talents equal to the composition
of original works of the same species with
the romance of Cervantes; so it is not perhaps
possible to conceive a writer more completely
qualified to give a perfect translation of that
romance.</p>

<p>Motteux, with no great abilities as an original
writer, appears to me to have been endowed with
a strong perception of the ridiculous in human
character; a just discernment of the weaknesses
and follies of mankind. He seems likewise to
have had a great command of the various styles
which are accommodated to the expression both
of grave burlesque, and of low humour. Inferior
to Smollet in inventive genius, he seems to have
equalled him in every quality which was essentially
requisite to a translator of <i>Don Quixote</i>.
It may therefore be supposed, that the contest
between them will be nearly equal, and the
question of preference very difficult to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
decided. It would have been so, had Smollet
confided in his own strength, and bestowed on
his task that time and labour which the length
and difficulty of the work required: but Smollet
too often wrote in such circumstances, that dispatch
was his primary object. He found various
English translations at hand, which he judged
might save him the labour of a new composition.
Jarvis could give him faithfully the sense of his
author; and it was necessary, only to polish his
asperities, and lighten his heavy and aukward
phraseology. To contend with Motteux, Smollet
found it necessary to assume the armour of
Jarvis. This author had purposely avoided,
through the whole of his work, the smallest
coincidence of expression with Motteux, whom,
with equal presumption and injustice, he accuses
in his preface of having “taken his version
wholly from the French.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> We find, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
both in the translation of Jarvis and in that of
Smollet, which is little else than an improved
edition of the former, that there is a studied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
rejection of the phraseology of Motteux. Now,
Motteux, though he has frequently assumed too
great a licence, both in adding to and retrenching
from the ideas of his original, has upon the
whole a very high degree of merit as a translator.
In the adoption of corresponding idioms
he has been eminently fortunate, and, as in these
there is no great latitude, he has in general preoccupied
the appropriated phrases; so that a
succeeding translator, who proceeded on the rule
of invariably rejecting his phraseology, must have,
in general, altered for the worse. Such, I have
said, was the rule laid down by Jarvis, and by
his copyist and improver, Smollet, who by thus
absurdly rejecting what his own judgement and
taste must have approved, has produced a composition
decidedly inferior, on the whole, to that
of Motteux. While I justify the opinion I have
now given, by comparing several passages of
both translations, I shall readily allow full credit
to the performance of Smollet, wherever I find
that there is a real superiority to the work of his
rival translator.</p>

<p>After Don Quixote’s unfortunate encounter
with the Yanguesian carriers, in which the
Knight, Sancho, and Rozinante, were all most
grievously mauled, his faithful squire lays his
master across his ass, and conducts him to the
nearest inn, where a miserable bed is made up
for him in a cock-loft. Cervantes then proceeds
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p><i>En esta maldita cama se accostó Don Quixote:
y luego la ventera y su hija le emplastáron de
arriba abaxo, alumbrandoles Maritornes: que asi
se llamaba la Asturiana. Y como al vizmalle,
viese la ventera tan acardenalado á partes á Don
Quixote, dixo que aquello mas parecian golpes que
caida. No fuéron golpes, dixo Sancho, sino que la
peña tenia muchos picos y tropezones, y que cada uno
habia hecho su cardinal, y tambien le dixo: haga
vuestra merced, señora, de manera que queden
algunas estopas, que no faltará quien las haya
menester, que tambien me duelen á mí un poco los
lomos. Desa manera, respondió la ventera, tambien
debistes vos de caer? No caí, dico Sancho
Panza, sino que del sobresalto que tome de ver
caer á mí amo, de tal manera me duele á mí
el cuerpo, que me parece que me han dado mil
palos.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Translation by Motteux</i></p>

<p>“In this ungracious bed was the Knight laid
to rest his belaboured carcase; and presently the
hostess and her daughter anointed and plastered
him all over, while Maritornes (for that was the
name of the Asturian wench) held the candle.
The hostess, while she greased him, wondering
to see him so bruised all over, I fancy, said she,
those bumps look much more like a dry beating
than a fall. ’Twas no dry beating, mistress, I
promise you, quoth Sancho; but the rock had I
know not how many cragged ends and knobs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
and every one of them gave my master a token
of its kindness. And by the way, forsooth, continued
he, I beseech you save a little of that
same tow and ointment for me too, for I don’t
know what’s the matter with my back, but I
fancy I stand mainly in want of a little greasing
too. What, I suppose you fell too, quoth the
landlady. Not I, quoth Sancho, but the very
fright that I took to see my master tumble
down the rock, has so wrought upon my body,
that I am as sore as if I had been sadly
mauled.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Translation by Smollet</i></p>

<p>“In this wretched bed Don Quixote having
laid himself down, was anointed from head to
foot by the good woman and her daughter, while
Maritornes (that was the Asturian’s name) stood
hard by, holding a light. The landlady, in the
course of her application, perceiving the Knight’s
whole body black and blue, observed, that those
marks seemed rather the effects of drubbing
than of a fall; but Sancho affirmed she was
mistaken, and that the marks in question were
occasioned by the knobs and corners of the
rocks among which he fell. And now, I think
of it, said he, pray, Madam, manage matters so
as to leave a little of your ointment, for it will
be needed, I’ll assure you: my own loins are
none of the soundest at present. What, did you
fall too, said she? I can’t say I did, answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
the squire; but I was so infected by seeing my
master tumble, that my whole body akes, as
much as if I had been cudgelled without
mercy.”</p>

<p>Of these two translations, it will hardly be
denied that Motteux’s is both easier in point of
style, and conveys more forcibly the humour of
the dialogue in the original. A few contrasted
phrases will shew clearly the superiority of the
former.</p>

<p><i>Motteux.</i> “In this ungracious bed was the
Knight laid to rest his belaboured carcase.”</p>

<p><i>Smollet.</i> “In this wretched bed Don Quixote
having laid himself down.”</p>

<p><i>Motteux.</i> “While Maritornes (for that was
the name of the Asturian wench) held the
candle.”</p>

<p><i>Smollet.</i> “While Maritornes (that was the
Asturian’s name) stood hard by, holding a
light.”</p>

<p><i>Motteux.</i> “The hostess, while she greased him.”</p>

<p><i>Smollet.</i> “The landlady, in the course of her
application.”</p>

<p><i>Motteux.</i> “I fancy, said she, those bumps
look much more like a dry beating than a fall.”</p>

<p><i>Smollet.</i> “Observed, that those marks seemed
rather the effect of drubbing than of a fall.”</p>

<p><i>Motteux.</i> “’Twas no dry beating, mistress, I
promise you, quoth Sancho.”</p>

<p><i>Smollet.</i> “But Sancho affirmed she was in a
mistake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p><i>Motteux.</i> “And, by the way, forsooth, continued
he, I beseech you save a little of that
same tow and ointment for me; for I don’t know
what’s the matter with my back, but I fancy I
stand mainly in need of a little greasing too.”</p>

<p><i>Smollet.</i> “And now, I think of it, said he,
pray, Madam, manage matters so as to leave a
little of your ointment, for it will be needed, I’ll
assure you: my own loins are none of the
soundest at present.”</p>

<p><i>Motteux.</i> “What, I suppose you fell too,
quoth the landlady? Not I, quoth Sancho, but
the very fright,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Smollet.</i> “What, did you fall too, said she?
I can’t say I did, answered the squire; but I
was so infected,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>There is not only more ease of expression
and force of humour in Motteux’s translation
of the above passages than in Smollet’s, but
greater fidelity to the original. In one part, <i>no
fueron golpes</i>, Smollet has improperly changed
the first person for the third, or the colloquial
style for the narrative, which materially weakens
the spirit of the passage. <i>Cada uno habia hecho
su cardenal</i> is most happily translated by Motteux,
“every one of them gave him a token of
its kindness;” but in Smollet’s version, this
spirited clause of the sentence evaporates altogether.—<i>Algunas
estopas</i> is more faithfully
rendered by Motteux than by Smollet. In the
latter part of the passage, when the hostess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
jeeringly says to Sancho, <i>Desa manera tambien
debistes vos de caer?</i> the squire, impatient to
wipe off that sly insinuation against the veracity
of his story, hastily answers, <i>No cai</i>. To this
Motteux has done ample justice, “Not I, quoth
Sancho.” But Smollet, instead of the arch
effrontery which the author meant to mark by
this answer, gives a tame apologetic air to the
squire’s reply, “I can’t say I did, answered the
squire.” <i>Don Quix.</i> par. 1, cap. 16.</p>

<p>Don Quixote and Sancho, travelling in the
night through a desert valley, have their ears
assailed at once by a combination of the most
horrible sounds, the roaring of cataracts, clanking
of chains, and loud strokes repeated at
regular intervals; all which persuade the Knight,
that his courage is immediately to be tried in
a most perilous adventure. Under this impression,
he felicitates himself on the immortal
renown he is about to acquire, and brandishing
his lance, thus addresses Sancho, whose joints
are quaking with affright:</p>

<p><i>Asi que aprieta un poco las cinchas a Rocinante,
y quédate a Dios, y asperame aqui hasta tres dias,
no mas, en los quales si no volviere, puedes tú
volverte á nuestra aldea, y desde allí, por hacerme
merced y buena obra, irás al Toboso, donde dirás
al incomparable señora mia Dulcinea, que su
cautivo caballero murió por acometer cosas, que le
hiciesen digno de poder llamarse suyo.</i> Don
Quix. par. 1, cap. 20.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Translation by Motteux</i></p>

<p>“Come, girth Rozinante straiter, and then
Providence protect thee: Thou may’st stay for
me here; but if I do not return in three days,
go back to our village, and from thence, for my
sake, to Toboso, where thou shalt say to my
incomparable lady Dulcinea, that her faithful
knight fell a sacrifice to love and honour, while
he attempted things that might have made him
worthy to be called her adorer.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Translation by Smollet</i></p>

<p>“Therefore straiten Rozinante’s girth, recommend
thyself to God, and wait for me in this
place, three days at farthest; within which time
if I come not back, thou mayest return to our
village, and, as the last favour and service done
to me, go from thence to Toboso, and inform my
incomparable mistress Dulcinea, that her captive
knight died in attempting things that might
render him worthy to be called her lover.”</p>

<p>On comparing these two translations, that of
Smollet appears to me to have better preserved
the ludicrous solemnity of the original. This is
particularly observable in the beginning of the
sentence, where there is a most humorous association
of two counsels very opposite in their
nature, the recommending himself to God, and
girding Rozinante. In the request, “and as the
last favour and service done to me, go from
thence to Toboso;” the translations of Smollet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
and Motteux are, perhaps, nearly equal in
point of solemnity, but the simplicity of the
original is better preserved by Smollet.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Sancho, after endeavouring in vain to dissuade
his master from engaging in this perilous adventure,
takes advantage of the darkness to tie
Rozinante’s legs together, and thus to prevent him
from stirring from the spot; which being done,
to divert the Knight’s impatience under this
supposed enchantment, he proceeds to tell him,
in his usual strain of rustic buffoonery, a long
story of a cock and a bull, which thus begins:
“<i>Erase que se era, el bien que viniere para todos
sea, y el mal para quien lo fuere á buscar; y
advierta vuestra merced, señor mio, que el principio
que los antiguos dieron a sus consejas, no fue así
como quiera, que fue una sentencia de Caton Zonzorino
Romano que dice, y el mal para quien lo
fuere á buscar.</i>” Ibid.</p>

<p>In this passage, the chief difficulties that occur
to the translator are, <i>first</i>, the beginning, which
seems to be a customary prologue to a nursery-tale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
among the Spaniards, which must therefore
be translated by a corresponding phraseology in
English; and <i>secondly</i>, the blunder of <i>Caton
Zonzorino</i>. Both these are, I think, most happily
hit off by Motteux. “In the days of yore,
when it was as it was, good betide us all, and
evil to him that evil seeks. And here, Sir, you
are to take notice, that they of old did not begin
their tales in an ordinary way; for ’twas a
saying of a wise man, whom they call’d Cato
the Roman Tonsor, that said, Evil to him that
evil seeks.” Smollet thus translates the passage:
“There was, so there was; the good that shall
fall betide us all; and he that seeks evil may
meet with the devil. Your worship may take
notice, that the beginning of the ancient tales is
not just what came into the head of the teller:
no, they always began with some saying of Cato,
the censor of Rome, like this, of “He that seeks
evil may meet with the devil.”</p>

<p>The beginning of the story, thus translated,
has neither any meaning in itself, nor does it
resemble the usual preface of a foolish tale.
Instead of <i>Caton Zonzorino</i>, a blunder which
apologises for the mention of Cato by such an
ignorant clown as Sancho, we find the blunder
rectified by Smollet, and Cato distinguished by
his proper epithet of the Censor. This is a
manifest impropriety in the last translator, for
which no other cause can be assigned, than that
his predecessor had preoccupied the blunder of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
<i>Cato the Tonsor</i>, which, though not a translation
of <i>Zonzorino</i>, (the purblind), was yet a very
happy parallelism.</p>

<p>In the course of the same cock-and-bull story,
Sancho thus proceeds: “<i>Asi que, yendo dias y
viniendo dias, el diablo que no duerme y que todo
lo añasca, hizo de manera, que el amor que el pastor
tenia á su pastora se volviese en omecillo y mala
voluntad, y la causa fué segun malas lenguas, una
cierta cantidad de zelillos que ella le dió, tales que
pasaban de la raya, y llegaban á lo vedado, y fue
tanto lo que el pastor la aborreció de alli adelante,
que por on verla se quiso ausentar de aquella
tierra, é irse donde sus ojos no la viesen jamas: la
Toralva, que se vió desdeñada del Lope, luego le
quiso bien mas que nunca le habla querido.</i>” Ibid.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Translation by Motteux</i></p>

<p>“Well, but, as you know, days come and go,
and time and straw makes medlars ripe; so it
happened, that after several days coming and
going, the devil, who seldom lies dead in a
ditch, but will have a finger in every pye, so
brought it about, that the shepherd fell out with
his sweetheart, insomuch that the love he bore
her turned into dudgeon and ill-will; and the
cause was, by report of some mischievous tale-carriers,
that bore no good-will to either party,
for that the shepherd thought her no better than
she should be, a little loose i’ the hilts, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
Thereupon being grievous in the dumps about it,
and now bitterly hating her, he e’en resolved to
leave that country to get out of her sight: for
now, as every dog has his day, the wench perceiving
he came no longer a suitering to her, but
rather toss’d his nose at her and shunn’d her, she
began to love him, and doat upon him like any
thing.”</p>

<p>I believe it will be allowed, that the above
translation not only conveys the complete sense
and spirit of the original, but that it greatly improves
upon its humour. When Smollet came
to translate this passage, he must have severely
felt the hardship of that law he had imposed on
himself, of invariably rejecting the expressions of
Motteux, who had in this instance been eminently
fortunate. It will not therefore surprise us, if
we find the new translator to have here failed as
remarkably as his predecessor has succeeded.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Translation by Smollet</i></p>

<p>“And so, in process of time, the devil, who
never sleeps, but <i>wants to have a finger in every
pye</i>, managed matters in such a manner, that the
shepherd’s love for the shepherdess was turned
into malice and deadly hate: and the cause,
according to evil tongues, was a certain quantity
of small jealousies she gave him, exceeding all
bounds of measure. And such was the abhorrence
the shepherd conceived for her, that, in order to
avoid the sight of her, he resolved to absent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
himself from his own country, and go where he
should never set eyes on her again. Toralvo
finding herself despised by Lope, began to love
him more than ever.”</p>

<p>Smollet, conscious that in the above passage
Motteux had given the best possible <i>free</i> translation,
and that he had supplanted him in the
choice of corresponding idioms, seems to have
piqued himself on a rigid adherence to the very
<i>letter</i> of his original. The only English idiom,
being a plagiarism from Motteux, “<i>wants to
have a finger in every pye</i>,” seems to have been
adopted from absolute necessity: the Spanish
phrase would not bear a literal version, and no
other idiom was to be found but that which
Motteux had preoccupied.</p>

<p>From an inflexible adherence to the same
law, of invariably rejecting the phraseology of
Motteux, we find in every page of this new
translation numberless changes for the worse:</p>

<p><i>Se que no mira de mal ojo á la mochacha.</i></p>

<p>“I have observed he casts a sheep’s eye at the
wench.” <i>Motteux.</i></p>

<p>“I can perceive he has no dislike to the girl.”
<i>Smollet.</i></p>

<p><i>Teresa me pusieron en el bautismo, nombre
mondo y escueto, sin anadiduras, ni cortopizas, ni
arrequives de Dones ni Donas.</i></p>

<p>“I was christened plain Teresa, without any
fiddle-faddle, or addition of Madam, or Your
Ladyship.” <i>Motteux.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“Teresa was I christened, a bare and simple
name, without the addition, garniture, and embroidery
of Don or Donna.” <i>Smollet.</i></p>

<p><i>Sigue tu cuenta, Sancho.</i></p>

<p>“Go on with thy story, Sancho.” <i>Motteux.</i></p>

<p>“Follow thy story, Sancho.” <i>Smollet.</i></p>

<p><i>Yo confieso que he andado algo risueño en
demasía.</i></p>

<p>“I confess I carried the jest too far.” <i>Motteux.</i></p>

<p>“I see I have exceeded a little in my
pleasantry.” <i>Smollet.</i></p>

<p><i>De mis viñas vengo, no se nada, no soy amigo de
saber vidas agenas.</i></p>

<p>“I never thrust my nose into other men’s
porridge; it’s no bread and butter of mine:
Every man for himself, and God for us all, say
I.” <i>Motteux.</i></p>

<p>“I prune my own vine, and I know nothing
about thine. I never meddle with other people’s
concerns.” <i>Smollet.</i></p>

<p><i>Y advierta que ya tengo edad para dar consejos.
Quien bien tiene, y mal escoge, por bien que se enoja,
no se venga.</i><a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>“Come, Master, I have hair enough in my
beard to make a counsellor: he that will not
when he may, when he will he shall have nay.”
<i>Motteux.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>“Take notice that I am of an age to give good
counsels. He that hath good in his view, and
yet will not evil eschew, his folly deserveth to
rue.” <i>Smollet.</i> Rather than adopt a corresponding
proverb, as Motteux has done, Smollet
chuses, in this instance, and in many others, to
make a proverb for himself, by giving a literal
version of the original in a sort of doggrel
rhime.</p>

<p><i>Vive Roque, que es la señora nuestra amo mas
ligera que un alcotan, y que puede enseñar al mas
diestro Cordobes o Mexicano.</i></p>

<p>“By the Lord Harry, quoth Sancho, our Lady
Mistress is as nimble as an eel. Let me be
hang’d, if I don’t think she might teach the best
Jockey in Cordova or Mexico to mount a-horseback.”
<i>Motteux.</i></p>

<p>“By St. Roque, cried Sancho, my Lady
Mistress is as light as a hawk,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and can teach the
most dexterous horseman to ride.” <i>Smollet.</i></p>

<p>The chapter which treats of the puppet-show,
is well translated both by Motteux and Smollet.
But the discourse of the boy who explains the
story of the piece, in Motteux’s translation,
appears somewhat more consonant to the phraseology
commonly used on such occasions:
“Now, gentlemen, in the next place, mark that
personage that peeps out there with a crown on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
his head, and a sceptre in his hand: That’s the
Emperor Charlemain.—Mind how the Emperor
turns his back upon him.—Don’t you see that
Moor;—hear what a smack he gives on her
sweet lips,—and see how she spits, and wipes her
mouth with her white smock-sleeve. See how
she takes on, and tears her hair for very madness,
as if it was to blame for this affront.—Now
mind what a din and hurly-burly there is.”
<i>Motteux.</i> This jargon appears to me to be
more characteristic of the speaker than the
following: “And that personage who now appears
with a crown on his head and a sceptre in
his hand, is the Emperor Charlemagne.—Behold
how the Emperor turns about and walks off.—Don’t
you see that Moor;—Now mind how he
prints a kiss in the very middle of her lips, and
with what eagerness she spits, and wipes them
with the sleeve of her shift, lamenting aloud, and
tearing for anger her beautiful hair, as if it had
been guilty of the transgression.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>In the same scene of the puppet-show, the
scraps of the old Moorish ballad are translated
by Motteux with a corresponding naïveté of expression,
which it seems to me impossible to
exceed:</p>

<p>How miserably does the new translator sink
in the above comparison! Yet Smollet was a
good poet, and most of the verse translations
interspersed through this work are executed
with ability. It is on this head that Motteux<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
has assumed to himself the greatest licence.
He has very presumptuously mutilated the
poetry of Cervantes, by leaving out many
entire stanzas from the larger compositions,
and suppressing some of the smaller altogether:
Yet the translation of those parts which he
has retained, is possessed of much poetical
merit; and in particular, those verses which are
of a graver cast, are, in my opinion, superior to
those of his rival. The song in the first volume,
which in the original is intitled <i>Cancion de
Grisōstomo</i>, and which Motteux has intitled,
<i>The Despairing Lover</i>, is greatly abridged by
the suppression of more than one half of the
stanzas in the original; but the translation, so
far as it goes, is highly poetical. The translation
of this song by Smollet, though inferior as a
poem, is, perhaps, more valuable on the whole,
because more complete. There is, however, only
a single passage in which he maintains with
Motteux a contest which is nearly equal:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O thou, whose cruelty and hate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The tortures of my breast proclaim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold, how willingly to fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I offer this devoted frame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If thou, when I am past all pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shouldst think my fall deserves a tear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let not one single drop distain</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Those eyes, so killing and so clear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No! rather let thy mirth display</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The joys that in thy bosom flow:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah! need I bid that heart be gay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which always triumph’d in my woe. <i>Smollet.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>It will be allowed that there is much merit in
these lines, and that the last stanza in particular
is eminently beautiful and delicate. Yet there
is in my opinion an equal vein of poetry, and
more passion, in the corresponding verses of
Motteux:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O thou, by whose destructive hate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’m hurry’d to this doleful fate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When I’m no more, thy pity spare!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I dread thy tears; oh, spare them then—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, oh! I rave, I was too vain—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My death can never cost a tear! <i>Motteux.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the song of Cardenio, there is a happy
combination of tenderness of expression with
ingenious thought; the versification is likewise
of a peculiar structure, the second line forming
an echo to the first. This song has been
translated in a corresponding measure both by
Motteux and Smollet; but by the latter with
far inferior merit.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>“The torments then that I endure—no <i>mortal</i>
remedy can cure.” Who ever heard of a <i>mortal</i>
remedy? or who could expect to be cured by
it? In the next line, the epithet of <i>languid</i> is
injudiciously given to Hope in this place; for a
<i>languid</i> or a <i>languishing</i> hope was already dying,
and needed not so powerful a host of murderers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
to <i>slay</i> it, as Absence, Jealousy, and Disdain.—In
short, the latter translation appears to me to
be on the whole of much inferior merit to the
former. I have remarked, that Motteux excels
his rival chiefly in the translation of those poems
that are of a graver cast. But perhaps he is
censurable for having thrown too much gravity
into the poems that are interspersed in this
work, as Smollet is blameable on the opposite
account, of having given them too much the air
of burlesque. In the song which Don Quixote
composed while he was doing penance in the
<i>Sierra-Morena</i>, beginning <i>Arboles, Yerbas y
Plantas</i>, every stanza of which ends with <i>Del
Toboso</i>, the author intended, that the composition
should be quite characteristic of its author, a
ludicrous compound of gravity and absurdity.
In the translation of Motteux there is perhaps
too much gravity; but Smollet has rendered
the composition altogether burlesque. The same
remark is applicable to the song of Antonio,
beginning <i>Yo sé, Olalla, que me adoras</i>, and to
many of the other poems.</p>

<p>On the whole, I am inclined to think, that the
version of Motteux is by far the best we have
yet seen of the Romance of Cervantes; and that
if corrected in its licentious abbreviations and
enlargements, and in some other particulars
which I have noticed in the course of this comparison,
we should have nothing to desire
superior to it in the way of translation.</p>

<p>In the two preceding chapters I have treated
pretty fully of what I have considered as a principal
difficulty in translation, the permutation of
idioms. I shall in this chapter touch upon
several other characteristics of composition,
which, in proportion as they are found in original
works, serve greatly to enhance the difficulty of
doing complete justice to them in a translation.</p>

<p>1. The poets, in all languages, have a licence
peculiar to themselves, of employing a mode of
expression very remote from the diction of prose,
and still more from that of ordinary speech.
Under this licence, it is customary for them to
use antiquated terms, to invent new ones, and
to employ a glowing and rapturous phraseology,
or what Cicero terms <i>Verba ardentia</i>. To do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
justice to these peculiarities in a translation, by
adopting similar terms and phrases, will be found
extremely difficult; yet, without such assimilation,
the translation presents no just copy of the
original. It would require no ordinary skill to
transfuse into another language the thoughts of
the following passages, in a similar species of
phraseology:</p>

<p>2. There is nothing more difficult to imitate
successfully in a translation than that species of
composition which conveys just, simple, and
natural thoughts, in plain, unaffected, and perfectly
appropriate terms; and which rejects all
those <i>aucupia sermonis</i>, those <i>lenocinia verborum</i>,
which constitute what is properly termed <i>florid
writing</i>. It is much easier to imitate in a translation
that kind of composition (provided it be
at all intelligible),<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> which is brilliant and rhetorical,
which employs frequent antitheses, allusions,
similes, metaphors, than it is to give a perfect
copy of just, apposite, and natural sentiments,
which are clothed in pure and simple language:
For the former characters are strong and prominent,
and therefore easily caught; whereas the
latter have no striking attractions, their merit
eludes altogether the general observation, and
is discernible only to the most correct and
chastened taste.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to approach to the beautiful
simplicity of expression of the following
passages, in any translation.</p>

<p>“In those vernal seasons of the year, when
the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury
and sullenness against Nature, not to go out
to see her riches, and partake in her rejoicing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
with heaven and earth.” Milton’s <i>Tract of
Education</i>.</p>

<p>“Can I be made capable of such great expectations,
which those animals know nothing
of, (happier by far in this regard than I am, if
we must die alike), only to be disappointed at
last? Thus placed, just upon the confines of
another, better world, and fed with hopes of
penetrating into it, and enjoying it, only to
make a short appearance here, and then to be
shut out and totally sunk? Must I then, when
I bid my last farewell to these walks, when I
close these lids, and yonder blue regions and all
this scene darken upon me and go out; must I
then only serve to furnish dust to be mingled
with the ashes of these herds and plants, or
with this dirt under my feet? Have I been set
so far above them in life, only to be levelled with
them at death?” Wollaston’s <i>Rel. of Nature</i>,
sect. ix.</p>

<p>3. The union of just and delicate sentiments
with simplicity of expression, is more rarely
found in poetical composition than in prose;
because the enthusiasm of poetry prompts rather
to what is brilliant than what is just, and is
always led to clothe its conceptions in that
species of figurative language which is very
opposite to simplicity. It is natural, therefore,
to conclude, that in those few instances which
are to be found of a chastened simplicity of
thought and expression in poetry, the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
of transfusing the same character into a translation
will be great, in proportion to the difficulty
of attaining it in the original. Of this
character are the following beautiful passages
from Chaulieu:</p>

<p>4. The foregoing examples exhibit a species
of composition, which uniting just and natural
sentiments with simplicity of expression, preserves
at the same time a considerable portion
of elevation and dignity. But there is another
species of composition, which, possessing the
same union of natural sentiments with simplicity
of expression, is essentially distinguished from
the former by its always partaking, in a considerable
degree, of comic humour. This is that
kind of writing which the French characterise
by the term <i>naif</i>, and for which we have no
perfectly corresponding expression in English.
“Le naif,” says Fontenelle, “est une nuance du
bas.”</p>

<p>In the following fable of Phædrus, there is a
<i>naïveté</i>, which I think it is scarcely possible to
transfuse into any translation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="center"><i>Inops potentem dum vult imitari, perit.</i></p>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In prato quædam rana conspexit bovem;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et tacta invidiâ tantæ magnitudinis</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rugosam inflavit pellem: tum natos suos</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Interrogavit, <i>an bove esset latior</i>.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Illi <i>negarunt</i>. Rursus intendit cutem</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Majore nisu, et simili quæsivit modo</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Quis major esset?</i> Illi dixerunt, <i>bovem</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Novissimè indignata, dum vult validius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inflare sese, rupto jacuit corpore.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It would be extremely difficult to attain, in
any translation, the laconic brevity with which
this story is told. There is not a single word
which can be termed superfluous; yet there is
nothing wanting to complete the effect of the
picture. The gravity, likewise, of the narrative
when applied to describe an action of the most
consummate absurdity; the self-important, but
anxious questions, and the mortifying dryness of
the answers, furnish an example of a delicate
species of humour, which cannot easily be
conveyed by corresponding terms in another
language. La Fontaine was better qualified
than any another for this attempt. He saw the
merits of the original, and has endeavoured
to rival them; but even La Fontaine has
failed.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Tout marquis veut avoir des pages.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But La Fontaine himself when original, is
equally inimitable. The source of that <i>naïveté</i>
which is the characteristic of his fables, has been
ingeniously developed by Marmontel: “Ce n’est
pas un poete qui imagine, ce n’est pas un conteur
qui plaisante; c’est un temoin present à l’action,
et qui veut vous rendre present vous-même. Il
met tout en oeuvre de la meilleure foi du monde
pour vous persuader; et ce sont tous ces efforts,
c’est le sérieux avec lequel il mêle les plus
grandes choses avec les plus petites; c’est l’importance
qu’il attache à des jeux d’enfans; c’est
l’interêt qu’il prend pour un lapin et une belette,
qui font qu’on est tenté de s’écrier a chaque
instant, <i>Le bon homme!</i> On le disoit de lui dans
la societé. Son caractere n’a fait que passer dans
ses fables. C’est du fond de ce caractere que
sont émanés ces tours si naturels, ces expressions
si naïves, ces images si fideles.”</p>

<p>It would require most uncommon powers to
do justice in a translation to the natural and
easy humour which characterises the dialogue in
the following fable:</p>

<p>5. No compositions will be found more difficult
to be translated, than those descriptions, in
which a series of minute distinctions are marked
by characteristic terms, each peculiarly appropriated
to the thing to be designed, but many of
them so nearly synonymous, or so approaching
to each other, as to be clearly understood only
by those who possess the most critical knowledge
of the language of the original, and a very
competent skill in the subject treated of. I have
always regarded Strada’s <i>Contest of the Musician<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
and Nightingale</i>, as a composition which almost
bids defiance to the art of a translator. The
reader will easily perceive the extreme difficulty
of giving the full, distinct, and appropriate
meaning of those expressions marked in Italics.</p>

<p>It must be here remarked, that Strada has not
the merit of originality in this characteristic
description of the song of the Nightingale. He
found it in Pliny, and with still greater amplitude,
and variety of discrimination. He seems
even to have taken from that author the hint of
his fable: “Digna miratu avis. Primum, tanta
vox tam parvo in corpusculo, tam pertinax
spiritus. Deinde in una perfecta musicæ scientia
modulatus editur sonus; et nunc continuo
spiritu trahitur in longum, nunc variatur inflexo,
nunc distinguitur conciso, copulatur intorto, promittitur
revocato, infuscatur ex inopinato: interdum
et secum ipse murmurat, plenus, gravis,
acutus, creber, extentus; ubi visum est vibrans,
summus, medius, imus. Breviterque omnia tam
parvulis in faucibus, quæ tot exquisitis tibiarum
tormentis ars hominum excogitavit.—Certant
inter se, palamque animosa contentio est. Victa
morte finit sæpe vitam, spiritu prius deficiente
quam cantu.” Plin. <i>Nat. Hist.</i> lib. 10, c. 29.</p>

<p>It would perhaps be still more difficult to give
a perfect translation of this passage from Pliny,
than of the fable of Strada. The attempt, however,
has been made by an old English author,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
Philemon Holland; and it is curious to remark
the extraordinary shifts to which he has
been reduced in the search of corresponding
expressions:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Explorat numeros, chordaque laborat in omni.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Surely this bird is not to be set in the last
place of those that deserve admiration; for is it
not a wonder, that so loud and clear a voice
should come from so little a body? Is it not
as strange, that shee should hold her wind so
long, and continue with it as shee doth? Moreover,
shee alone in her song keepeth time and
measure truly, she riseth and falleth in her note
just with the rules of music, and perfect harmony;
for one while, in one entire breath she drawes out
her tune at length treatable; another while she
quavereth, and goeth away as fast in her running
points: sometimes she maketh stops and short
cuts in her notes; another time she gathereth in
her wind, and singeth descant between the plain
song: she fetcheth in her breath again, and then
you shall have her in her catches and divisions:
anon, all on a sudden, before a man would think
it, she drowneth her voice that one can scarce
heare her; now and then she seemeth to record
to herself, and then she breaketh out to sing
voluntarie. In sum, she varieth and altereth her
voice to all keies: one while full of her largs,
longs, briefs, semibriefs, and minims; another
while in her crotchets, quavers, semiquavers, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
double semiquavers: for at one time you shall
hear her voice full of loud, another time as low;
and anon shrill and on high; thick and short
when she list; drawn out at leisure again when
she is disposed; and then, (if she be so pleased),
shee riseth and mounteth up aloft, as it were with
a wind organ. Thus shee altereth from one to
another, and sings all parts, the treble, the mean,
and the base. To conclude, there is not a pipe
or instrument devised with all the art and cunning
of man, that can affoord more musick than this
pretty bird doth out of that little throat of hers.—They
strive who can do best, and one laboreth
to excel another in variety of song and long
continuance; yea, and evident it is that they
contend in good earnest with all their will and
power: for oftentimes she that hath the worse,
and is not able to hold out with another, dieth
for it, and sooner giveth she up her vitall breath,
than giveth over her song.”</p>

<p>The consideration of the above passage in the
original, leads to the following remark.</p>

<p>5. There is no species of writing so difficult to
be translated, as that where the character of the
style is florid, and the expression consequently
vague, and of indefinite meaning. The natural
history of Pliny furnishes innumerable examples
of this fault; and hence it will ever be found
one of the most difficult works to be translated.
A short chapter shall be here analyzed, as an
instructive specimen.</p>

<p>Although, after the perusal of the whole of this
chapter, we are at no loss to understand its general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
meaning, yet when it is taken to pieces, we shall
find it extremely difficult to give a precise interpretation,
much less an elegant translation of
its single sentences. The latter indeed may be
accounted impossible, without the exercise of
such liberties as will render the version rather
a paraphrase than a translation. <i>In magnis
siquidem corporibus, aut certe majoribus, facilis
officina sequaci materiæ fuit.</i> The sense of the
term magnus, which is in itself indefinite, becomes
in this sentence much more so, from its opposition
to <i>major</i>; and the reader is quite at a loss
to know, whether in those two classes of animals,
the <i>magni</i> and the <i>majores</i>, the largest animals
are signified by the former term, or by the latter.
Had the opposition been between <i>magnus</i> and
<i>maximus</i>, or <i>major</i> and <i>maximus</i>, there could
not have been the smallest ambiguity. <i>Facilis
officina sequaci materiæ fuit.</i> <i>Officina</i> is the
workhouse where an artist exercises his craft;
but no author, except Pliny himself, ever employed
it to signify the labour of the artist.
With a similar incorrectness of expression, which,
however, is justified by general use, the French
employ <i>cuisine</i> to signify both the place where
victuals are dressed, and the art of dressing
them. <i>Sequax materia</i> signifies pliable materials,
and therefore easily wrought; but the term
<i>sequax</i> cannot be applied with any propriety to
such materials as are easily wrought, on account
of their magnitude or abundance. <i>Tam parvis</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
is easily understood, but <i>tam nullis</i> has either no
meaning at all, or a very obscure one. <i>Inextricabilis
perfectio.</i> It is no perfection in anything
to be inextricable; for the meaning of
inextricable is, embroiled, perplexed, and confounded.
<i>Ubi tot sensus collocavit in culice?</i>
What is the meaning of the question <i>ubi</i>?
Does it mean, in what part of the body of the
gnat? I conceive it can mean nothing else:
And if so, the question is absurd; for all the
senses of a gnat are not placed in any <i>one</i> part
of its body, any more than the senses of a man.
<i>Dictu minora.</i> By these words the author intended
to convey the meaning of <i>alia etiam
minora possunt dici</i>; but the meaning which
he has actually conveyed is, <i>Sunt alia minora
quam quæ dici possunt</i>, which is false and hyperbolical;
for no insect is so small that words may
not be found to convey an idea of its size. <i>Portione
maximam vocem ingeneravit.</i> What is <i>portione
maximam</i>? It is only from the context that
we guess the author’s meaning to be, <i>maximam
ratione portionis</i>, i. e. <i>magnitudinis insecti</i>; for
neither use, nor the analogy of the language,
justify such an expression as <i>vocem maximam
portione</i>. If it is alledged, that <i>portio</i> is here
used to signify the power or intensity of the
voice, and is synonymous in this place to <i>vis</i>,
ενεργεια, we may safely assert, that this use of
the term is licentious, improper, and unwarranted
by custom. <i>Jejunam caveam uti alvum</i>; “a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
hungry cavity for a belly:” but is not the
stomach of all animals a hungry cavity, as well
as that of the gnat? <i>Capaci cum cernere non
potest exilitas.</i> <i>Capax</i> is improperly contrasted
with <i>exilis</i>, and cannot be otherwise translated
than in the sense of <i>magnus</i>. <i>Reciproca geminavit
arte</i> is incapable of any translation which
shall render the proper sense of the words,
“doubled with reciprocal art.” The author’s
meaning is, “fitted for a double function.” <i>Cum
sono teste</i> is guessed from the context to mean,
<i>uti sonus testatur</i>. <i>Cum rerum natura nusquam
magis quam in minimis tota sit.</i> This is a very
obscure expression of a plain sentiment, “The
wisdom and power of Providence, or of Nature,
is never more conspicuous than in the smallest
bodies.” Ex his <i>spernunt multa</i>. The meaning
of <i>ex his</i> is indefinite, and therefore obscure:
we can but conjecture that it means <i>ex rebus
hujusmodi</i>; and not <i>ex his quæ diximus</i>; for
that sense is reserved for <i>relata</i>.</p>

<p>From this specimen, we may judge of the
difficulty of giving a <i>just translation</i> of Pliny’s
<i>Natural History</i>.</p>

<p class="subhead">OF BURLESQUE TRANSLATION.—TRAVESTY
AND PARODY.—SCARRON’S VIRGILE TRAVESTI.—ANOTHER
SPECIES OF LUDICROUS
TRANSLATION.</p>

</div>

<p>In a preceding chapter, while treating of the
translation of idiomatic phrases, we censured the
use of such idioms in the translation as do not
correspond with the age or country of the
original. There is, however, one species of
translation, in which that violation of the <i>costume</i>
is not only blameless, but seems essential to the
nature of the composition: I mean burlesque
translation, or Travesty. This species of writing
partakes, in a great degree, of original composition;
and is therefore not to be measured by
the laws of serious translation. It conveys
neither a just picture of the sentiments, nor a
faithful representation of the style and manner of
the original; but pleases itself in exhibiting a
ludicrous caricatura of both. It displays an
overcharged and grotesque resemblance, and
excites our risible emotions by the incongruous
association of dignity and meanness, wisdom
and absurdity. This association forms equally
the basis of Travesty and of Ludicrous Parody,
from which it is no otherwise distinguished than
by its assuming a different language from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
original. In order that the mimickry may be
understood, it is necessary that the writer choose,
for the exercise of his talents, a work that is
well known, and of great reputation. Whether
that reputation is deserved or unjust, the work
may be equally the subject of burlesque imitation.
If it has been the subject of general, but
undeserved praise, a Parody or a Travesty is
then a fair satire on the false taste of the original
author, and his admirers, and we are pleased to
see both become the objects of a just castigation.
The <i>Rehearsal</i>, <i>Tom Thumb</i>, and <i>Chrononhotonthologos</i>,
which exhibit ludicrous parodies of
passages from the favourite dramatic writers of
the times, convey a great deal of just and useful
criticism. If the original is a work of real excellence,
the Travesty or Parody detracts nothing
from its merit, nor robs the author of the smallest
portion of his just praise.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> We laugh at the
association of dignity and meanness; but the
former remains the exclusive property of the
original, the latter belongs solely to the copy.
We give due praise to the mimical powers of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
imitator, and are delighted to see how ingeniously
he can elicit subject of mirth and ridicule
from what is grave, dignified, pathetic, or
sublime.</p>

<p>In the description of the games in the 5th
<i>Æneid</i>, Virgil everywhere supports the dignity
of the Epic narration. His persons are heroes,
their actions are suitable to that character, and
we feel our passions seriously interested in the
issue of the several contests. The same scenes
travestied by Scarron are ludicrous in the extreme.
His heroes have the same names, they
are engaged in the same actions, they have even
a grotesque resemblance in character to their
prototypes; but they have all the meanness,
rudeness, and vulgarity of ordinary prize-fighters,
hackney coachmen, horse-jockeys, and water-men.</p>

<p>In Scarron, the prizes are accommodated to
the contending parties with equal propriety:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Et plusieurs autres nippes rares, &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this species of composition pleases only in
a short specimen. We cannot bear a lengthened
work in Travesty. The incongruous association
of dignity and meanness excites risibility chiefly
from its being unexpected. Cotton’s and Scarron’s
<i>Virgil</i> entertain but for a few pages: the
composition soon becomes tedious, and at length
disgusting. We laugh at a short exhibition of
buffoonery; but we cannot endure a man, who,
with good talents, is constantly playing the
fool.</p>

<p>There is a species of ludicrous verse translation
which is not of the nature of Travesty, and
which seems to be regulated by all the laws of
serious translation. It is employed upon a
ludicrous original, and its purpose is not to
burlesque, but to represent it with the utmost
fidelity. For that purpose, even the metrical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
stanza is closely imitated. The ludicrous effect
is heightened, when the stanza is peculiar in its
structure, and is transferred from a modern to
an ancient language; as in Dr. Aldrich’s translation
of the well-known song,</p>

<p class="subhead">THE GENIUS OF THE TRANSLATOR SHOULD
BE AKIN TO THAT OF THE ORIGINAL
AUTHOR.—THE BEST TRANSLATORS HAVE

FRENCH TRANSLATION OF HUDIBRAS.—TRANSLATION

AND MOTTEUX.</p>

</div>

<p>From the consideration of those general rules
of translation which in the foregoing essay I have
endeavoured to illustrate, it will appear no unnatural
conclusion to assert, that he only is
perfectly accomplished for the duty of a translator
who possesses a genius akin to that of the
original author. I do not mean to carry this
proposition so far as to affirm, that in order to
give a perfect translation of the works of Cicero,
a man must actually be as great an orator, or
inherit the same extent of philosophical genius;
but he must have a mind capable of discerning
the full merits of his original, of attending with
an acute perception to the whole of his reasoning,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
and of entering with warmth and energy of
feeling into all the beauties of his composition.
Thus we shall observe invariably, that the best
translators have been those writers who have
composed original works of the same species with
those which they have translated. The mutilated
version which yet remains to us of the <i>Timæus</i>
of Plato translated by Cicero, is a masterly composition,
which, in the opinion of the best judges,
rivals the merit of the original. A similar commendation
cannot be bestowed on those fragments
of the <i>Phænomena</i> of Aratus translated
into verse by the same author; for Cicero’s
poetical talents were not remarkable: but who
can entertain a doubt, that had time spared to us
his versions of the orations of Demosthenes and
Æschines, we should have found them possessed
of the most transcendent merit?</p>

<p>We have observed, in the preceding part of
this essay, that poetical translation is less subjected
to restraint than prose translation, and
allows more of the freedom of original composition.
It will hence follow, that to exercise this
freedom with propriety, a translator must have
the talent of original composition in poetry; and
therefore, that in this species of translation, the
possession of a genius akin to that of his author,
is more essentially necessary than in any other.
We know the remark of Denham, that the subtle
spirit of poesy evaporates entirely in the transfusion
from one language into another, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
unless a new, or an original spirit, is infused by
the translator himself, there will remain nothing
but a <i>caput mortuum</i>. The best translators of
poetry, therefore, have been those who have
approved their talents in original poetical composition.
Dryden, Pope, Addison, Rowe, Tickell,
Pitt, Warton, Mason, and Murphy, rank equally
high in the list of original poets, as in that of the
translators of poetry.</p>

<p>But as poetical composition is various in its
kind, and the characters of the different species
of poetry are extremely distinct, and often
opposite in their nature, it is very evident that
the possession of talents adequate to one species
of translation, as to one species of original poetry,
will not infer the capacity of excelling in other
species of which the character is different. Still
further, it may be observed, that as there are
certain species of poetical composition, as, for
example, the dramatic, which, though of the
same general character in all nations, will take
a strong tincture of difference from the manners
of a country, or the peculiar genius of a people;
so it will be found, that a poet, eminent as an
original author in his own country, may fail
remarkably in attempting to convey, by a translation,
an idea of the merits of a foreign work
which is tinctured by the national genius of the
country which produced it. Of this we have a
striking example in those translations from
Shakespeare by Voltaire; in which the French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
poet, eminent himself in dramatical composition,
intended to convey to his countrymen a just
idea of our most celebrated author in the same
department. But Shakespeare and Voltaire,
though perhaps akin to each other in some of
the great features of the mind, were widely
distinguished, even by nature, in the characters
of their poetical genius; and this natural distinction
was still more sensibly increased by
the general tone of manners, the <i>hue and fashion</i>
of thought of their respective countries. Voltaire,
in his essay <i>sur la Tragédie Angloise</i>, has chosen
the famous soliloquy in the tragedy of Hamlet,
“<i>To be, or not to be</i>,” as one of those striking
passages which best exemplify the genius of
Shakespeare, and which, in the words of the
French author, <i>demandent grace pour toutes ses
fautes</i>. It may therefore be presumed, that the
translator in this instance endeavoured, as far as
lay in his power, not only to adopt the spirit of
his author, but to represent him as favourably as
possible to his countrymen. Yet, how wonderfully
has he metamorphosed, how miserably disfigured
him! In the original, we have the
perfect picture of a mind deeply agitated, giving
vent to its feelings in broken starts of utterance,
and in language which plainly indicates, that the
speaker is reasoning solely with his own mind,
and not with any auditor. In the translation,
we have a formal and connected harangue, in
which it would appear, that the author, offended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
with the abrupt manner of the original, and
judging those irregular starts of expression to
be unsuitable to that precision which is required
in abstract reasoning, has corrected, as he
thought, those defects of the original, and given
union, strength, and precision, to this philosophical
argument.</p>

<p>Besides the general fault already noticed, of
substituting formal and connected reasoning, to
the desultory range of thought and abrupt
transitions of the original, Voltaire has in this
passage, by the looseness of his paraphrase,
allowed some of the most striking beauties, both
of the thought and expression, entirely to escape;
while he has superadded, with unpardonable
licence, several ideas of his own, not only unconnected
with the original, but dissonant to
the general tenor of the speaker’s thoughts, and
foreign to his character. Adopting Voltaire’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
own style of criticism on the translations of the
Abbé des Fontaines, we may ask him, “Where
do we find, in this translation of Hamlet’s
soliloquy,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To take arms against a sea of troubles——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That flesh is heir to——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perchance to dream; ay, there’s the rub——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The whips and scorns of time——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The law’s delay, the insolence of office——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spurns—that patient merit from th’ unworthy takes——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That undiscover’d country, from whose bourne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No traveller returns——?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Can Voltaire, who has omitted in this short
passage all the above striking peculiarities of
thought and expression, be said to have given
a translation from Shakespeare?</p>

<p>But in return for what he has retrenched from
his author, he has made a liberal addition of
several new and original ideas of his own.
Hamlet, whose character in Shakespeare exhibits
the strongest impressions of religion, who feels
these impressions even to a degree of superstition,
which influences his conduct in the most important
exigences, and renders him weak and
irresolute, appears in Mr. Voltaire’s translation
a thorough sceptic and freethinker. In the
course of a few lines, he expresses his doubt of
the existence of a God; he treats the priests as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
liars and hypocrites, and the Christian religion
as a system which debases human nature, and
makes a coward of a hero:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dieux justes! S’il en est——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">De nos prêtres menteurs bénir l’hypocrisie——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et d’un héros guerrier, fait un Chrêtien timide——</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, who gave Mr. Voltaire a right thus to
transmute the pious and superstitious Hamlet
into a modern <i>philosophe</i> and <i>Esprit fort</i>?
Whether the French author meant by this
transmutation to convey to his countrymen a
favourable idea of our English bard, we cannot
pretend to say; but we may at least affirm, that
he has not conveyed a just one.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>But what has prevented the translator, who
professes that he wished to give a just idea of the
merits of his original, from accomplishing what
he wished? Not ignorance of the language; for
Voltaire, though no great critic in the English
tongue, had yet a competent knowledge of it;
and the change he has put upon the reader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
was not involuntary, or the effect of ignorance.
Neither was it the want of genius, or of poetical
talents; for Voltaire is certainly one of the best
poets, and one of the greatest ornaments of the
drama. But it was the original difference of his
genius and that of Shakespeare, increased by the
general opposition of the national character of
the French and English. His mind, accustomed
to connect all ideas of dramatic sublimity or
beauty with regular design and perfect symmetry
of composition, could not comprehend this union
of the great and beautiful with irregularity of
structure and partial disproportion. He was
capable indeed of discerning some features of
majesty in this colossal statue; but the rudeness
of the parts, and the want of polish in the whole
figure, prevailed over the general impression
of its grandeur, and presented it altogether to
his eye as a monstrous production.</p>

<p>The genius of Voltaire was more akin to
that of Dryden, of Waller, of Addison, and of
Pope, than to that of Shakespeare: he has therefore
succeeded much better in the translations
he has given of particular passages from these
poets, than in those he has attempted from our
great master of the drama.</p>

<p>Voltaire possessed a large share of wit; but it
is of a species peculiar to himself, and which I
think has never yet been analysed. It appears
to me to be the result of acute philosophical
talents, a strong spirit of satire, and a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
brilliant imagination. As all wit consists in
unexpected combinations, the singular union of
a philosophic thought with a lively fancy, which
is a very uncommon association, seems in
general to be the basis of the wit of Voltaire.
It is of a very different species from that wit
which is associated with humour, which is
exercised in presenting odd, extravagant, but
natural views of human character, and which
forms the essence of ludicrous composition.
The novels of Voltaire have no other scope than
to illustrate certain philosophical doctrines, or
to expose certain philosophical errors; they are
not pictures of life or of manners; and the
persons who figure in them are pure creatures
of the imagination, fictitious beings, who have
nothing of nature in their composition, and who
neither act nor reason like the ordinary race
of men. Voltaire, then, with a great deal of
wit, seems to have had no talent for humorous
composition. Now if such is the character of
his original genius, we may presume, that he
was not capable of justly estimating in the
compositions of others what he did not possess
himself. We may likewise fairly conclude, that
he should fail in attempting to convey by a
translation a just idea of the merits of a work, of
which one of the main ingredients is that quality
in which he was himself deficient. Of this I
proceed to give a strong example.</p>

<p>In the poem of <i>Hudibras</i>, we have a remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
combination of Wit with Humour; nor is it
easy to say which of these qualities chiefly predominates
in the composition. A proof that
humour forms a most capital ingredient is, that
the inimitable Hogarth has told the whole story
of the poem in a series of characteristic prints:
now painting is completely adequate to the
representation of humour, but can convey no
idea of wit. Of this singular poem, Voltaire has
attempted to give a specimen to his countrymen
by a translation; but in this experiment he says
he has found it necessary to concentrate the first
four hundred lines into little more than eighty
of the translation.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The truth is, that, either
insensible of that part of the merit of the original,
or conscious of his own inability to give a just
idea of it, he has left out all that constitutes the
humour of the painting, and attached himself
solely to the wit of the composition. In the
original, we have a description of the figure,
dress, and accoutrements of Sir Hudibras, which
is highly humorous, and which conveys to the
imagination as complete a picture as is given by
the characteristic etchings of Hogarth. In the
translation of Voltaire, all that we learn of those
particulars which <i>paint</i> the hero, is, that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
wore mustachios, and rode with a pair of
pistols.</p>

<p>Even the wit of the original, in passing through
the alembic of Voltaire, has changed in a great
measure its nature, and assimilated itself to that
which is peculiar to the translator. The wit of
Butler is more concentrated, more pointed, and
is announced in fewer words, than the wit of
Voltaire. The translator, therefore, though he
pretends to have abridged four hundred verses
into eighty, has in truth effected this by the
retrenchment of the wit of his original, and not
by the concentration of it: for when we compare
any particular passage or point, we find there is
more diffusion in the translation than in the
original. Thus, Butler says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The difference was so small, his brain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Outweigh’d his rage but half a grain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which made some take him for a tool</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That knaves do work with, call’d a fool.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus amplified by Voltaire, and at the same
time imperfectly translated.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mais malgré sa grande eloquence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et son mérite, et sa prudence,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Et qu’ils tournent avec souplesse;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cet instrument s’appelle un sot.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus likewise the famous simile of Taliacotius,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
loses, by the amplification of the translator, a
great portion of its spirit.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">But, when the date of nock was out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Off dropt the sympathetic snout.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ainsi Taliacotius,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Répara tous les nez perdus</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Le nez auprès de son derriere.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will be allowed, that notwithstanding the
supplemental witticism of the translator, contained
in the last four lines, the simile loses, upon
the whole, very greatly by its diffusion. The
following anonymous Latin version of this simile
is possessed of much higher merit, as, with equal
brevity of expression, it conveys the whole spirit
of the original.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>With these translations may be compared the
following, which is taken from a complete version
of the poem of <i>Hudibras</i>, a very remarkable
work, with the merits of which (as the book is
less known than it deserves to be) I am glad to
have this opportunity of making the English
reader acquainted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ainsi Talicot d’une fesse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Savoit tailler avec addresse</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Mais si le cul perdoit la vie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Le nez tomboit par sympathie.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In one circumstance of this passage no translation
can come up to the original: it is in that
additional pleasantry which results from the structure
of the verses, the first line ending most unexpectedly
with a preposition, and the third with
a pronoun, both which are the rhyming syllables
in the two couplets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So learned Taliacotius <i>from</i>, &amp;c.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cut supplemental noses, <i>which</i>, &amp;c.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was perhaps impossible to imitate this in a
translation; but setting this circumstance aside,
the merit of the latter French version seems
to me to approach very near to that of the
original.</p>

<p>The author of this translation of the poem of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
<i>Hudibras</i>, evidently a man of superior abilities,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
appears to have been endowed with an uncommon
share of modesty. He presents his work to
the public with the utmost diffidence; and, in a
short preface, humbly deprecates its censure for
the presumption that may be imputed to him in
attempting that which the celebrated Voltaire
had declared to be one of the most difficult of
tasks. Yet this task he has executed in a very
masterly manner. A few specimens will shew
the high merit of this work, and clearly evince,
that the translator possessed that essential
requisite for his undertaking, a kindred genius
with that of his great original.</p>

<p>The religion of Hudibras is thus described:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For his religion, it was fit</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Such as do build their faith upon</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">By apostolic blows and knocks.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Orthodoxe, à force de coups.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the following passage, the arch ratiocination
of the original is happily rivalled in the
translation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For Hudibras wore but one spur,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As wisely knowing could he stir</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Car Hudibras avec raison</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Qu’un coté marchant, l’autre arrive.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The language of Sir Hudibras is described as
a strange jargon, compounded of English, Greek,
and Latin,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">A leash of languages at once.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was difficult to do justice in the translation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
to the metaphor of Cerberus, by translating
<i>leash of languages</i>: This, however, is very
happily effected by a parallel witticism:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Japper trois langues différentes.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The wit of the following passage is completely
transfused, perhaps even heightened in the
translation:</p>

<p>The last specimen I shall give from this work,

in which the Knight proposes to prosecute
Sidrophel in an action of battery:</p>

<p>These specimens are sufficient to shew how
completely this translator has entered into the
spirit of his original, and has thus succeeded in
conveying a very perfect idea to his countrymen
of one of those works which are most
strongly tinctured with the peculiarities of
national character, and which therefore required
a singular coincidence of the talents of the
translator with those of the original author.</p>

<p>If the English can boast of any parallel to
this, in a version from the French, where the
translator has given equal proof of a kindred
genius to that of his original, and has as
successfully accomplished a task of equal
difficulty, it is in the translation of Rabelais,
begun by Sir Thomas Urquhart, and finished
by Mr. Motteux, and lastly, revised and corrected
by Mr. Ozell. The difficulty of translating this
work, arises less from its obsolete style, than
from a phraseology peculiar to the author, which
he seems to have purposely rendered obscure, in
order to conceal that satire which he levels both
against the civil government and the ecclesiastical
policy of his country. Such is the studied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
obscurity of this satire, that but a very few of
the most learned and acute among his own
countrymen have professed to understand
Rabelais in the original. The history of the
English translation of this work, is in itself a
proof of its very high merit. The three first
books were translated by Sir Thomas Urquhart,
but only two of them were published in his
lifetime. Mr. Motteux, a Frenchman by birth,
but whose long residence in England had given
him an equal command of both languages,
republished the work of Urquhart, and added
the remaining three books translated by himself.
In this publication he allows the excellence of
the work of his predecessor, whom he declares
to have been a complete master of the French
language, and to have possessed both learning
and fancy equal to the task he undertook. He
adds, that he has preserved in his translation “the
very style and air of his original;” and finally,
“that the English readers may now understand
that author better in their own tongue, than
many of the French can do in theirs.” The
work thus completed in English, was taken up
by Mr. Ozell, a person of considerable literary
abilities, and who possessed an uncommon knowledge
both of the ancient and modern languages.
Of the merits of the translation, none could be
a better judge, and to these he has given the
strongest testimony, by adopting it entirely in his
new edition, and limiting his own undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
solely to the correction of the text of Urquhart
and Motteux, to which he has added a translation
of the notes of M. Du Chat, who spent, as
Mr. Ozell informs us, forty years in composing
annotations on the original work. The English
version of Rabelais thus improved, may be
considered, in its present form, as one of the
most perfect specimens of the art of translation.
The best critics in both languages have borne
testimony to its faithful transfusion of the sense,
and happy imitation of the style of the original;
and every English reader will acknowledge, that
it possesses all the ease of original composition.
If I have forborne to illustrate any of the rules or
precepts of the preceding Essay from this work,
my reasons were, that obscurity I have already
noticed, which rendered it less fit for the purpose
of such illustration, and that strong tincture of
licentiousness which characterises the whole
work.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX4">No. IV</h3>

<p>A very learned and ingenious friend,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> to whom I am
indebted for some very just remarks, of which I have
availed myself in the preceding Essay, has furnished
me with the following acute, and, as I think, satisfactory
explanation of a passage in Tacitus, extremely
obscure in itself, and concerning the meaning of which
the commentators are not agreed. “Tacitus meaning
to say, ‘That Domitian, wishing to be the great, and
indeed the only object in the empire, and that no body
should appear with any sort of lustre in it but himself,
was exceedingly jealous of the great reputation which
Agricola had acquired by his skill in war,’ expresses
himself thus:</p>

<p class="center">In Vit. Agr. cap. 39</p>

<p>“<i>Id sibi maxime formidolosum, privati hominis nomen
suprà principis attolli. Frustra studia fori, et civilium
artium decus in silentium acta, si militarem gloriam
alius occuparet: et cætera utcunque facilius dissimulari,
ducis boni imperatoriam virtutem esse.</i> Which Gordon
translates thus: ‘Terrible above all things it was to
him, that the name of a private man should be exalted
above that of the Prince. In vain had he driven from
the public tribunals all pursuits of popular eloquence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
and fame, in vain repressed the renown of every civil
accomplishment, if any other than himself possessed
the glory of excelling in war: Nay, however he might
dissemble every other distaste, yet to the person of
Emperor properly appertained the virtue and praise of
being a great general.’</p>

<p>“This translation is very good, as far as the words
‘civil accomplishment,’ but what follows is not, in
my opinion, the meaning of Tacitus’s words, which I
would translate thus:</p>

<p>“‘If any other than himself should become a great
object in the empire, as that man must necessarily be
who possesses military glory. For however he might
conceal a value for excellence of every other kind, and
even affect a contempt of it, yet he could not but
allow, that skill in war, and the talents of a great
General, were an ornament to the Imperial dignity
itself.’</p>

<p>“Domitian did not pretend to any skill in war; and
therefore the word ‘<i>alius</i>’ could never be intended
to express a competitor with him in it.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> When the first edition of this Essay was published,
the Author had not seen Dr. Campbell’s new translation of
the Gospels, a most elaborate and learned work, in one of
the preliminary dissertations to which, that ingenious
writer has treated professedly “Of the chief things to be
attended to in translating.” The general laws of the art
as briefly laid down in the first part of that dissertation are
individually the same with those contained in this Essay;
a circumstance which, independently of that satisfaction
which always arises from finding our opinions warranted
by the concurring judgement of persons of distinguished
ingenuity and taste, affords a strong presumption that
those opinions are founded in nature and in common
sense. Another work on the same subject had likewise
escaped the Author’s observation when he first published
this Essay; an elegant poem on translation, by Mr.
Francklin, the ingenious translator of Sophocles and
Lucian. It is, however, rather an apology of the art, and
a vindication of its just rank in the scale of literature, than
a didactic work explanatory of its principles. But above
all, the Author has to regret, that, in spite of his most diligent
research, he has never yet been fortunate enough to
meet with the work of a celebrated writer, professedly on
the subject of translation, the treatise of M. Huet, Bishop
of Avranches, <i>De optimo genere interpretandi</i>; of whose
doctrines, however, he has some knowledge, from a pretty
full extract of his work in the <i>Dictionnaire Encyclopédique
de Grammaire et Litterature</i>, article <i>Traduction</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Founding upon this principle, which he has by no
means proved, That the arrangement of the Greek and
Latin languages is the order of nature, and that the
modern tongues ought never to deviate from that order,
but for the sake of sense, perspicuity, or harmony; he
proceeds to lay down such rules as the following: That
the periods of the translation should accord in all their
parts with those of the original—that their order, and
even their length, should be the same—that all conjunctions
should be scrupulously preserved, as being the
joints or articulations of the members—that all adverbs
should be ranged next to the verb, &amp;c. It may be confidently
asserted, that the Translator who shall endeavour
to conform himself to these rules, even with the licence
allowed of sacrificing to sense, perspicuity, and harmony,
will produce, on the whole, a very sorry composition, which
will be far from reflecting a just picture of his original.</p>

an authority as that of M. Delille; whose translation of
the <i>Georgics</i> of Virgil, though censurable, (as I shall
remark) in a few particulars, is, on the whole, a very fine
performance: “Il faut etre quelquefois superieur à son
original, précisément parce qu’on lui est très-inférieur.”

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> The following apology made by D’Ablancourt of
his own version of Tacitus, contains, however, many just
observations; from which, with a proper abatement
of that extreme liberty for which he contends, every
translator may derive much advantage.</p>

<p>Of Tacitus he thus remarks: “Comme il considere
souvent les choses par quelque biais étranger, il laisse
quelquefois ses narrations imparfaites, ce qui engendre
de l’obscurité dans ses ouvrages, outre la multitude des
fautes qui s’y rencontrent, et le peu de lumière qui nous
reste de la plupart des choses qui y sont traitées. Il ne
faut donc pas s’étonner s’il est si difficile à traduire,
puisqu’il est même difficile à entendre. D’ailleurs il a
accoutumé de méler dans une même période, et quelquefois
dans une même expression diverses pensées
qui ne tiennent point l’une à l’autre, et dont il faut perdre
une partie, comme dans les ouvrages qu’on polit, pour
pouvoir exprimer le reste sans choquer les délicatesses
de notre langue, et la justesse du raisonnement. Car on
n’a pas le même respect pour mon François que pour son
Latin; et l’on ne me pardonneroit pas des choses, qu’on
admire souvent chez lui, et s’il faut ainsi dire, qu’on
revere. Par tout ailleurs je l’ai suivi pas à pas, et plutôt
en esclave qu’en compagnon; quoique peut-être je me
pusse donner plus de liberté, puisque je ne traduis pas un
passage, mais un livre, de qui toutes les parties doivent
être unies ensemble, et comme fondues en un même corps.
D’ailleurs, la diversité qui se trouve dans les langues
est si grande, tant pour la construction et la forme des
périodes, que pour les figures et les autres ornemens,
qu’il faut à touts coups changer d’air et de visage, si
l’on ne veut faire un corps monstrueux, tel que celui des
traductions ordinaires, qui sont ou mortes et languissantes,
ou confuses et embrouillées, sans aucun ordre ni agrément.
Il faut donc prendre garde qu’on ne fasse perdre
la grace à son auteur par trop de scrupule, et que de
peur de lui manquer de foi en quelque chose, on ne lui
soit infidèle en tout: principalement, quand on fait
un ouvrage qui doit tenir lieu de l’original, et qu’on ne
travaille pas pour faire entendre aux jeunes gens le Grec
ou le Latin. Car on fait que les expressions hardies ne
sont point exactes, parce que la justesse est ennemie de
la grandeur, comme il se voit dans la peinture et dans
l’ecriture; mais la hardiesse du trait en supplée le défaut,
et elles sont trouvées plus belles de la sorte, que si elles
étoient plus régulières. D’ailleurs il est difficile d’etre
bien exact dans la traduction d’un auteur qui ne l’est
point. Souvent on est contraint d’ajouter quelque chose
à sa pensée pour l’eclaircir; quelquefois il faut en
retrancher une partie pour donner jour à tout le reste.
Cependant, cela fait que les meilleures traductions
paroissent les moins fideles; et un critique de notre tems
a remarqué deux mille fautes dans le Plutarque d’Amyot,
et un autre presqu’autant dans les traductions d’Erasme;
peut-être pour ne pas savoir que la diversité des langues
et des styles oblige à des traits tout differens, <i>parce que
l’Eloquence est une chose si delicate, qu’il ne faut quelquefois
qu’une syllabe pour la corrompre</i>. Car du reste, il n’y a
point d’apparence que deux si grands hommes se soient
abusés en tant de lieux, quoiqu’il ne soit pas étrange
qu’on se puisse abuser en quelque endroit. Mais tout le
monde n’est pas capable de juger d’une traduction,
quoique tout le monde s’en attribuë la connoissance; et
ici comme ailleurs, la maxime d’Aristote devroit servir de
regle, qu’il faut croire chacun en son art.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">[53]</a> There is, however, a very common mistake of translators
from the French into English, proceeding either
from ignorance, or inattention to the general construction
of the two languages. In narrative, or the description of
past actions, the French often use the present tense for
the preterite: <i>Deux jeunes nobles Mexicains jettent leurs
armes, et viennent à lui comme déserteurs. Ils mettent un
genouil à terre dans la posture des supplians; ils le
saisissent, et s’élancent de la platforme.—Cortez s’en débarasse,
et se retient à la balustrade. Les deux jeunes
nobles périssent sans avoir exécuté leur généreuse entreprise.</i>
Let us observe the aukward effect of a similar use of the
present tense in English. “Two young Mexicans of
noble birth throw away their arms and come to him as
deserters. They kneel in the posture of suppliants; they
seise him, and throw themselves from the platform.—Cortez
disengages himself from their grasp, and keeps
hold of the ballustrade. The noble Mexicans perish
without accomplishing their generous design.” In like
manner, the use of the present for the past tense is very
common in Greek, and we frequently remark the same
impropriety in English translations from that language.
“After the death of Darius, and the accession of Artaxerxes,
Tissaphernes accuses Cyrus to his brother of
treason: Artaxerxes gives credit to the accusation, and
orders Cyrus to be apprehended, with a design to put him
to death; but his mother having saved him by her intercession,
sends him back to his government.” Spelman’s
<i>Xenophon</i>. In the original, these verbs are put in the
present tense, διαβαλλει, πειθεται, συλλαμβανει, αποπεμπει.
But this use of the present tense in narrative is contrary
to the genius of the English language. The poets have
assumed it; and in them it is allowable, because it is
their object to paint scenes as present to the eye; <i>ut
pictura poesis</i>; but all that a prose narrative can pretend
to, is an animated description of things past: if it goes
any farther, it encroaches on the department of poetry.
In one way, however, this use of the present tense is
found in the best English historians, namely, in the summary
heads, or contents of chapters. “Lambert Simnel
invades England.—Perkin Warbeck is avowed by the
Duchess of Burgundy—he returns to Scotland—he is
taken prisoner—and executed.” Hume. But it is by an
ellipsis that the present tense comes to be thus used. The
sentence at large would stand thus. “<i>This chapter
relates how</i> Lambert Simnel invades England, <i>how</i>
Perkin Warbeck is avowed by the Duchess of Burgundy,”
&amp;c.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54" class="label">[54]</a> It is surprising that this fault should meet even with
approbation from so judicious a critic as Denham. In
the preface to his translation of the second book of the
<i>Æneid</i> he says: “As speech is the apparel of our
thoughts, so there are certain garbs and modes of
speaking which vary with the times; the fashion of our
clothes being not more subject to alteration, than that of
our speech: and this I think Tacitus means by that
which he calls <i>Sermonem temporis istius auribus accommodatum</i>,
the delight of change being as due to the
curiosity of the ear as of the eye: and therefore, if Virgil
must needs speak English, it were fit he should speak,
not only <i>as a man of this nation, but as a man of this
age</i>.” The translator’s opinion is exemplified in his
practice.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="label">[58]</a> The only French translation of <i>Don Quixote</i> I have
ever seen, is that to which is subjoined a continuation of
the Knight’s adventures, in two supplemental volumes,
by Le Sage. This translation has undergone numberless
editions, and is therefore, I presume, the best; perhaps
indeed the only one, except a very old version, which is
mentioned in the preface, as being quite literal, and very
antiquated in its style. It is therefore to be presumed,
that when Jarvis accuses Motteux of having taken his
version entirely from the French, he refers to that translation
above mentioned to which Le Sage has given a
supplement. If this be the case, we may confidently
affirm, that Jarvis has done Motteux the greatest injustice.
On comparing his translation with the French, there is a
discrepancy so absolute and universal, that there does
not arise the smallest suspicion that he had ever seen
that version. Let any passage be compared <i>ad aperturam
libri</i>; as, for example, the following:</p>

<p>“De simples huttes tenoient lieu de maisons, et de
palais aux habitants de la terre; les arbes se defaisant
d’eux-memes de leurs écorces, leur fournissoient de quoi
couvrir leurs cabanes, et se garantir de l’intempérie des
saisons.”</p>

<p>“The tough and strenuous cork-trees did of themselves,
and without other art than their native liberality, dismiss
and impart their broad, light bark, which served to cover
those lowly huts, propped up with rough-hewn stakes,
that were first built as a shelter against the inclemencies
of the air.”—<span class="smcap">Motteux.</span></p>

<p>“La beaute n’étoit point un avantage dangereux aux
jeunes filles; elles alloient librement partout, etalant sans
artifice et sans dessein tous les présents que leur avoit fait
la Nature, sans se cacher davantage, qu’autant que l’honnêteté
commune à tous les siecles l’a toujours demandé.”</p>

<p>“Then was the time, when innocent beautiful young
shepherdesses went tripping over the hills and vales,
their lovely hair sometimes plaited, sometimes loose and
flowing, clad in no other vestment but what was necessary
to cover decently what modesty would always have
concealed.”—<span class="smcap">Motteux.</span></p>

<p>It will not, I believe, be asserted, that this version of
Motteux bears any traces of being copied from the French,
which is quite licentious and paraphrastical. But when
we subjoin the original, we shall perceive, that he has
given a very just and easy translation of the Spanish.</p>

<p><i>Los valientes alcornoques despedian de sí sin otro artificio
que el de su cortesia, sus anchas y livianas cortezas, sin que
se commençaron á cubrir las casas, sobre rusticas, estacas
sustentadas, no mas que para defensa de las inclemencias
del cielo.</i></p>

<p><i>Entonces sí, que andaban las simples y hermosas zagalejas
de valle en valle, y de otero en otero, en trenza y en
cabello, sin mas vestidos de aquellos que eran menester
para cubrir honestamente lo que la honestidad quiere.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_59" href="#FNanchor_59" class="label">[59]</a> Perhaps a parody was here intended of the famous
epitaph of Simonides, on the brave Spartans who fell at
Thermopylæ:</p>

<p>“O stranger, carry back the news to Lacedemon, that
we died here to prove our obedience to her laws.” This,
it will be observed, may be translated, or at least
closely imitated, in the very words of Cervantes; <i>diras—que
su caballero murio por acometer cosas, que le hiciesen
digno de poder llamarse suyo</i>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_61" href="#FNanchor_61" class="label">[61]</a> Thus it stands in all the editions by the Royal
Academy of Madrid; though in Lord Carteret’s edition
the latter part of the proverb is given thus, apparently
with more propriety: <i>del mal que le viene no se enoje</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62" class="label">[62]</a> <i>Mas ligera que un alcotan</i> is more literally translated
by Smollet than by Motteux; but if Smollet piqued himself
on fidelity, why was <i>Cordobes o Mexicano</i> omitted?</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63" class="label">[63]</a> Smollet has here mistaken the sense of the original,
<i>como si ellos tuvieran la culpa del maleficio</i>: She did not
blame the hair for being guilty of the transgression or
offence, but for being the cause of the Moor’s transgression,
or, as Motteux has properly translated it, “this
affront.” In another part of the same chapter, Smollet
has likewise mistaken the sense of the original. When
the boy remarks, that the Moors don’t observe much form
or ceremony in their judicial trials, Don Quixote contradicts
him, and tells him there must always be a regular
process and examination of evidence to prove matters of
fact, “<i>para sacar una verdad en limpio menester son
muchas pruebas y repruebas</i>.” Smollet applies this
observation of the Knight to the boy’s long-winded story,
and translates the passage, “There is not so much proof
and counter proof required to bring truth to light.” In
both these passages Smollet has departed from his
prototype, Jarvis.</p>

author of the <i>Epistle of Abelard to Eloisa</i>, is a fable,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
